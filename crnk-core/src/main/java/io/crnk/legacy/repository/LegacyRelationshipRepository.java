/**
 * <p>
 * Base unidirectional document responsible for operations on relations. All of the methods in this interface have
 * fieldName field as last legacy. It solves a problem of many relationships between the same resources.
 * <p>
 * There are two methods that are used for To-One relationships:
 * <ul>
 * <li>setRelation</li>
 * <li>findOneRelations</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * There are four methods that are used for To-Many relationships:
 * <ul>
 * <li>setRelations</li>
 * <li>addRelation</li>
 * <li>removeRelation</li>
 * <li>findManyRelations</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * The reason why there is more than one method for To-Many relationships manipulation is to prevent
 * <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_condition">race condition</a> situations in which a field could be
 * changed concurrently by another request.
