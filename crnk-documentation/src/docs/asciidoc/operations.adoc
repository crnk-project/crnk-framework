# Bulk Updates with Operations Module

By its nature RESTful applications are limited to the insertion, update and deletion of single resources. As such, developers
have to design resources accordingly while having to consider aspects like transaction handling and atomicity. It is not
uncommon to combine multiple data objects on the server-side and expose it as single resource to clients. It is a simple
approach, but can also mean quite a substantial overhead when having to implement potentially redudant repositories.
Furthermore, things like validation handling, relationships and supporting complex object graphs can get tricky when a single
resource starts holding complex object graphs again.

For all the before mentioned reason support for http://jsonpatch.com/[jsonpatch.com] is provided. It allows to send multiple
insertions, updates and deletions with a single request and provides the results for each such executed operation.
Note that numerous attempts and discussions have taken place and are still ongoing to establish a common JSON:API standard,
but that does not seem to make much progress. With  http://jsonpatch.com/[jsonpatch.com] there is already an estabilished
standard that fits well for many use cases.

The implementation is provided as `OperationsModule` and the setup looks like:


[source]
----
		OperationsModule operationsModule = OperationsModule.create();
		...
----

Further filters can be applied to intercept incoming requests. Typically applications will make use of that to start a new
transaction spanning all requests. This looks as follows:

[source]
.AbstractOperationsTest.java
----
include::../../../../crnk-operations/src/test/java/io/crnk/operations/AbstractOperationsTest.java[tags=transaction]
----

There is further an operations client implementation that works along the regular JSON:API client implementation:

[source]
.OperationsPostTest.java
----
include::../../../../crnk-operations/src/test/java/io/crnk/operations/OperationsPostTest.java[tags=client]
----

## Operation Module Properties

The operations module can be customized using one of the following properties:

.Operation Module Properties
|===
|*Property Name* |*Description* |*Default Value*
|resumeOnError | If an error occurs during the operation execution, continue the other operations. | False
|includeChangedRelationships | Toggle to include all changed relationships in the request by default. This only applies for POST and PATCH operation requests. | True
|displayOperationResponseOnSuccess | If true, the response will always be included. Otherwise, it only displays the status codes of the operation unless an error has occurred. | True
|===

Here is an example of how to set these properties:

[source]
----
OperationsModule operationsModule = OperationsModule.create();
operationsModule.setIncludeChangedRelationships(false);
operationsModule.resumeOnError(true);
...
----

## Example Request and Response

An example request in JSON looks like:

[source]
----
[ {
  "op" : "POST",
  "path" : "movie",
  "value" : {
    "id" : "43e7903e-9b14-4610-96f5-69d6f2fa347d",
    "type" : "movie",
    "attributes" : {
      "title" : "test",
      ...
    },
    "relationships" : {
      ...
    }
  }
}, {
  "op" : "POST",
  "path" : "person",
  "value" : {
    "id" : "b25bfdbd-8dd6-4abd-a859-f1dedf85246b",
    "type" : "person",
    "attributes" : {
      "name" : "1",
      "version" : null
    }
  }
}, {
  "op" : "POST",
  "path" : "person",
  "value" : {
    "id" : "f9d2bda5-d2f4-4c0c-85c7-cc56b6ea91e6",
    "type" : "person",
    "attributes" : {
      "name" : "2",
      "version" : null
    }
  }
} ]
----

and an example response JSON looks as follows:

[source]
----
[ {
  "data" : {
    "id" : "43e7903e-9b14-4610-96f5-69d6f2fa347d",
    "type" : "movie",
    "attributes" : {
      "title" : "test",
      ...
    },
    "relationships" : {
      ..
    },
    "links" : {
      "self" : "http://localhost:58367/movie/43e7903e-9b14-4610-96f5-69d6f2fa347d"
    }
  },
  "status" : 201
}, {
  "data" : {
    "id" : "b25bfdbd-8dd6-4abd-a859-f1dedf85246b",
    "type" : "person",
    "attributes" : {
      "name" : "1",
      "version" : 0
    },
    "relationships" : {
      ...
    },
    "links" : {
      "self" : "http://localhost:58367/person/b25bfdbd-8dd6-4abd-a859-f1dedf85246b"
    }
  },
  "status" : 201
}, {
  "data" : {
    "id" : "f9d2bda5-d2f4-4c0c-85c7-cc56b6ea91e6",
    "type" : "person",
    "attributes" : {
      "name" : "2",
      "version" : 0
    },
    "relationships" : {
      ...
    },
    "links" : {
      "self" : "http://localhost:58367/person/f9d2bda5-d2f4-4c0c-85c7-cc56b6ea91e6"
    }
  },
  "status" : 201
} ]
----

Notice in the response a status code for each request. It is import for the `Content-Type` and `Accept` HTTP headers
to have `application/json-patch+json`, otherwise the `OperationsModule` will ignore such requests.

The current limitations of the implementation are:

- Does so far not support bulk update of relationships.

With support for `GET` (find-one only), `POST`, `PATCH` and `DELETE` operations the most important building blocks should be in place.
The limitations are expected to be addressed at some point as well, contributions welcomed.

There is experimental support for <<resource_bulk_repository,BulkResourceRepository>>. If multiple changes to the
same repository are detected, it can make use of the appropriate bulk methods.
