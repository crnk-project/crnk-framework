# Client

There is a client implementation for Java and Android projects to allow
communicating with JSON-API compliant servers. Two http client libraries are supported:

* ` <http://square.github.io/>`
  Library has been used to allow usage in both Android and server applications and services.

* `Apache Http Client <https://hc.apache.org/httpcomponents-client-ga/index.html>`
  Library widely used in the Java community.

* `RestTemplate` from Spring that provides a Spring abstraction for `` and other HTTP libraries.
  Spring application benefit from using this over the underlying native implementation to share
  the setup configuration setup. It is used by default if the presence of Spring is detected.

Add one of those library to the classpath and Crnk will pick it up automatically.

To start using the client just create an instance of `CrnkClient` and pass the service
URL as parameter.

## Usage

The client has three main methods:

* `CrnkClient#getRepositoryForInterface(Class)` to obtain a resource repository stub from an existing repository interface.
* `CrnkClient#getRepositoryForType(Class)` to obtain a generic resource repository stub from the provided resource type.
* `CrnkClient#getRepositoryForType(Class, Class)` to obtain a generic relationship repository stub from the provided source and target resource types.

The interface of the repositories is as same as defined in `Repositories`_ section.

An example of the usage:

[source]
----
  CrnkClient client = new CrnkClient("http://localhost:8080/api");
  ResourceRepositoryV2<Task, Long> taskRepo = client.getRepositoryForType(Task.class);
  List<Task> tasks = taskRepo.findAll(new QuerySpec(Task.class));
----

Have a look at, for example, the QuerySpecClientTest to see more examples of how it is used.


## Modules

`CrnkClient` can be extended by modules:

[source]
----
  CrnkClient client = new CrnkClient("http://localhost:8080/api");
  client.addModule(ValidationModule.create());
----

Typical use cases include:

- adding exception mappers
- registering new types of resources (like JPA entities by the `JpaModule`)
- intercepting requests for monitoring
- adding security tokens to requests

Many modules allow a registration both on server and client side.
The client part then typically makes use of a subset of the server features, like
exception mappers and resource registrations.

There is a mechanism to discover and register client modules automatically:

[source]
----
  CrnkClient client = new CrnkClient("http://localhost:8080/api");
  client.findModules();
----

`findModules` makes use of `java.util.ServiceLoader` and looks up
for `ClientModuleFactory`. `JpaModule`, `ValidationModule`,
`MetaModule`, `SecurityModule` implement such a service registration.
In contrast, `BraveModule` needs a Brave instance and does not yet
allow a fully automated setup.


## Type-Safety

It is possible to work with `CrnkClient` in a fully type-safe manner.

In a first step an interface for a repository is defined:

[source]
.ScheduleRepository.java
----
include::../../../../crnk-test/src/main/java/io/crnk/test/mock/repository/ScheduleRepository.java[tags=doc]
----

And then it can be used like:

[source]
.QuerySpecClientTest.java
----
include::../../../../crnk-client/src/test/java/io/crnk/client/QuerySpecClientTest.java[tags=interfaceAccess]
----

## JAX-RS interoperability

The interface stubs from the previous section can also be used to make calls to JAX-RS. For example, the
`ScheduleRepository` can be complemented with a JAX-RS annotation:

[source]
.ScheduleRepository.java
----
include::../../../../crnk-test/src/main/java/io/crnk/test/mock/repository/ScheduleRepository.java[tags=annotation]
----

and further JAX-RS services can be added:

[source]
.ScheduleRepository.java
----
include::../../../../crnk-test/src/main/java/io/crnk/test/mock/repository/ScheduleRepository.java[tags=services]
----

To make this work a dependency to `org.glassfish.jersey.ext:jersey-proxy-client` must be added and `JerseyActionStubFactory`
registered with `CrnkClient`:

[source]
.AbstractClientTest.java
----
include::../../../../crnk-client/src/test/java/io/crnk/client/AbstractClientTest.java[tags=jerseyStubFactory]
----

Then a client can make use the Crnk stubs and it will transparently switch between JSON-API and JAX-RS calls:

[source]
.JsonApiActionResponseTest.java
----
include::../../../../crnk-client/src/test/java/io/crnk/client/action/JsonApiActionResponseTest.java[tags=invokeService]
----

WARNING: Due to limited configurability of the Jersey Proxies it is currently not possible to reuse the same HTTP connections
for both types of calls. We attempt to address that in the future. Be aware of this when you, for example, add further
request headers (like security), as it has to be done in two places (unfortunately).



## HTTP customization

It is possible to hook into the HTTP implementation used by Crnk ( or Apache).
Make use of `CrnkClient#getHttpAdapter()` and cast it to either
`HttpClientAdapter` or `Adapter`. Both implementations provide a
`addListener` method, which in turn gives access to the native builder used to construct
the respective HTTP client implementation. This allows to cover various use cases:

- add custom request headers (security, tracing, etc.)
- collect statistics
- ...

You may have a look at `crnk-brave` for an advanced example.
