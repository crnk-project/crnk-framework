# Formats

By default Crnk follows the JSON:API specification to establish a REST endpoint. This chapter outlines the support
for formats other than JSON:API.

anchor:format_plain[]

## Plain JSON

The relationships and inclusions mechanisms of JSON:API allow to built powerful applications. But
sometimes those advanced features can also make simpler applications harder to write.
For example, clients do not have direct access to relationships, but rather have the resolve them through their
identifiers.

`crnk-format-plain-json` hosts the `PlainJsonFormatModule` that allows to setup a simpler,
non-JSON:API format. The module can be applied both to CrnkBoot and CrnkClient. An example looks like:

[source]
.http://localhost:8080/tasks/12
----
{
  "data" : {
    "id" : "12",
    "type" : "tasks",
    "name" : "someTask",
    "schedule" : {
      "data" : null,
      "links" : {
        "self" : "http://localhost:8080/tasks/12/relationships/schedule",
        "related" : "http://localhost:8080/tasks/12/schedule"
      }
    },
    "project" : {
      "data" : {
        "id" : "1",
        "type" : "projects",
        "name" : "someProject"
      },
      "links" : {
        "self" : "http://localhost:8080/tasks/12/relationships/project",
        "related" : "http://localhost:8080/tasks/12/project"
      }
    }
  }
}
----

Most notably the project relationship is directly inlined within the task. And a resource is written in a more flat manner without the
`attributes` and `relationships` containers. Contributions to add more flexibility to the module are always welcome.

Note that the JSON:API endpoint remains fully functional. The HTTP `Accept` and `Content-Type` headers are used to select
the format. As such, the Crnk client continues to make use of the JSON:API format. Related to this there is
a `format` attribute for
the Typescript generator to select the desired format for generation:

[source]
----
crnkGen{

  typescript{
    ...
    format = 'PLAINJSON' // or 'JSONAPI'
  }
}
