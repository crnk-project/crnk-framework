## JPA Module

The JPA module allows to automatically expose JPA entities as JSON API repositories. No implementation
or Crnk-specific annotations are necessary.

The feature set includes:

- expose JPA entities to JSON API repositories
- expose JPA relations as JSON API repositories
- decide which entities to expose as endpoints
- sorting, filtering, paging, inclusion of related resources.
- all default operators of crnk are supported: `EQ`, `NEQ`, `LIKE`, `LT`, `LE`, `GT`, `GE`.
- filter, sort and include parameters can make use of the dot notation to
  join to related entities. For example, `sort=-project.name,project.id`,
   `filter[project.name][NEQ]=someValue` or `include=project.tasks`.
- support for entity inheritance by allowing sorting, filtering and inclusions
  to refer to attributes on subtypes.
- support for Jackson annotations to customize entity attributes on the JSON API layer, see <<jackson_annotations,here>>.
- DTO mapping support to map entities to DTOs before sending them to clients.
- JPA Criteria API and QueryDSL support to issue queries.
- filter API to intercept and modify issued queries.
- support for computed attributes behaving like regular, persisted attributes.
- automatic transaction handling spanning requests and doing a rollback in case of an exception.
- `OptimisticLockExceptionMapper` mapped to JSON API errors with
  `409` status code.
- `PersistenceException` and `RollbackException` are unwrapped
   to the usually more interesting exceptions like
   `ValidationException` and then translated to JSON API errors.

Have a look at the Spring Boot example application which makes use of the JPA module, DTO mapping
and computed attributes.

Not yet supported are:

- sparse field sets.

### JPA Setup

To use the module, add a dependency to `io.crnk:crnk-jpa` and register the `JpaModule`
to Crnk. For example in the case of JAX-RS:

[source]
----
	TransactionRunner transactionRunner = ...;
	JpaModule jpaModule = JpaModule.newServerModule(entityManagerFactory, entityManager, transactionRunner);
	jpaModule.setRepositoryFactory(new ValidatedJpaRepositoryFactory());

	CrnkFeature feature = new CrnkFeature(...);
	feature.addModule(jpaModule);
----


The JPA modules by default looks up the entityManagerFactory and obtains a list
of registered JPA entities. For each entity a instance of `JpaEntityRepository`
is registered to Crnk using the module API. Accordingly, every relation
is registered as `JpaRelationshipRepository`. `JpaModule.setRepositoryFactory`
allows to provide a factory to change or customized the used repositories.
To manually select the entities exposed to Crnk use `JpaModule.addEntityClass(...)`
and `JpaModule.removeEntityClass(...)`. If no `entityManagerFactory` is provided
to newServerModule, then the registration of entities is omitted and can be done
manually.

The transactionRunner needs to be implemented by the application to hook into the
transaction processing of the used environment (Spring, JEE, etc.). This might be
as simple as a Spring bean implementing `TransactionRunner` and adding a
`@Transactional` annotation. The JPA module makes sure that every call to a
repository happens within such a transaction boundary.

To setup a Crnk client with the JPA module use:


[source]
----
	client = new CrnkClient(getBaseUri().toString());

	JpaModule module = JpaModule.newClientModule();
	setupModule(module, false);
	client.addModule(module);
----

Have a look at https://github.com/crnk-project/crnk-framework/blob/develop/crnk-jpa/src/test/java/io/crnk/jpa/JpaQuerySpecEndToEndTest.java within the `crnk-jpa`
test cases to see how everything is used together with `crnk-client`.
The JPA modules further has a number of more advanced customization options that
are discussed in the subsequent sections.


### Pagination

The JPA module implements both pagination approaches supported by Crnk.
Setting `JpaModule.setTotalResourceCountUsed(true|false)` allows to decide whether the total
number of resources should be counted or whether just the presence of a subsequent resource
is checked (by querying `limit + 1` entities). By default the total resources
are counted. Have a look at the <<pagination>> section for more information.


### Criteria API and QueryDSL

The JPA module can work with two different query APIs, the default Criteria API
and QueryDSL. `JpaModule.setQueryFactory` allows
to choose between those two implementation. There is the `JpaCriteriaQueryFactory`
and the `QuerydslQueryFactory`. By default the Criteria API is used.
QueryDSL sits on top of JPQL and has to advantage of being easier to use.


### Customizing the JPA repository

The setup page outlined the `JpaRepositoryFactory` that can be used to hook a custom JPA repository
implementations into the JPA module. The JPA module further provides a more
lightweight filter API to perform various changes to JPA repository requests:

`JpaModule.addFilter(new MyRepositoryFilter())`

A filter looks like:

[source]
----
	public class MyRepositoryFilter extends JpaRepositoryFilterBase {

		boolean accept(Class<?> resourceType){...}

		<T, I extends Serializable> JpaEntityRepository<T, I> filterCreation(JpaEntityRepository<T, I> repository){...}

		QuerySpec filterQuerySpec(Object repository, QuerySpec querySpec){...}

		...
	}
----


The various filter methods allow a wide variety of customizations or also to replace the passed object in question.


### DTO Mapping

Mapping to DTO objects is supported with `JpaModule.registerMappedEntityClass(...)`.
A mapper then can be provided that translates the Entity to a DTO class.
Such a mapper might be implemented manually or generated (mostly) automatically
with tools like MapStruct. If two mapped entities are registered, there
respective mapped relationships will be automatically registered as well.

The mechanism is not limited to simple mappings, but can also introduce computed
attributes like in the example depicted here:

[source]
----
	JpaModule module = JpaModule.newServerModule(emFactory, em, transactionRunner);
				module.setQueryFactory(QuerydslQueryFactory.newInstance());
	QuerydslExpressionFactory<QTestEntity> basicComputedValueFactory = new QuerydslExpressionFactory<QTestEntity>() {

		@Override
		public Expression<String> getExpression(QTestEntity parent, JPAQuery<?> jpaQuery) {
			return parent.stringValue.upper();
		}
	};

	QuerydslQueryFactory queryFactory = (QuerydslQueryFactory) module.getQueryFactory();
	queryFactory.registerComputedAttribute(TestEntity.class, TestDTO.ATTR_COMPUTED_UPPER_STRING_VALUE,
		 String.class, basicComputedValueFactory);
	module.addMappedEntityClass(TestEntity.class, TestDTO.class, new TestDTOMapper(entityManager));
----

and

[source]
----
	public class TestDTOMapper implements JpaMapper<TestEntity, TestDTO> {

		@Override
		public TestDTO map(Tuple tuple) {
			TestDTO dto = new TestDTO();
			TestEntity entity = tuple.get(0, TestEntity.class);
			dto.setId(entity.getId());
			dto.setStringValue(entity.getStringValue());
			dto.setComputedUpperStringValue(tuple.get("computedUpperStringValue", String.class));
			...
			return dto;
		}

		...

	}
----

Some of the regular entity attributes are mapped to the DTO. But there is also a
`computedUpperStringValue` attribute that is computed with an expression.
The expression can be written with the Criteria API or QueryDSL depending
on which query backend is in use.

Computed attributes are indistinguishable from regular, persisted entity attributes.
They can be used for selection, sorting and filtering. Both `JpaCriteriaQueryFactory`
and `QuerydslQueryFactory` provide a `registerComputedAttribute` method to
register an expression factory to create such computed attributes. The registration requires
the target entity and a name. To make the computed attribute available
to consumers, the mapper class has access to it trough the provided
tuple class. Have a look at https://github.com/crnk-project/crnk-framework/blob/develop/crnk-jpa/src/test/java/io/crnk/jpa/mapping/DtoMappingTest.java to see everything in use.

There is currently not yet any support for renaming of attribute. If attributes
are renamed on DTOs, the incoming QuerySpec has to be modified accordingly to
match again the entity attribute naming.


anchor:validation_module[]

## JSR 303 Validation Module

A `ValidationModule` provided by `io.crnk:crnk-validation` implements
exception mappers for `javax.validation.ValidationException` and `javax.validation.ConstraintViolationException`.
Among others, it properly translates 'javax.validation.ConstraintViolation' instances to JSON API errors.
A JSON API error can, among others, contain a source pointer. This source pointer allows a clients/UI to
display the validation errors next to the corresponding input fields.

A translated exception can look like:

[source]
----
{
	"errors": [
		{
			"status": "422",
			"code": "javax.validation.constraints.NotNull",
			"title": "may not be null",
			"source": {
				"pointer": "data/attributes/name"
			},
			"meta": {
				"resourceId": "1",
				"type": "ConstraintViolation",
				"messageTemplate": "{javax.validation.constraints.NotNull.message}",
				"resourceType": "projects"
			}
		}
	]
}
----

Notice the `422` status code used for such errors.


anchor:brave_module[]

## Tracing with Zipkin/Brave

A `BraveModule` provided by `io.crnk:crnk-brave` provides integration into
Zipkin/Brave to implement tracing for your repositories.  The module is applicable to
both a Crnk client or server.

The Crnk client can make use of either HttpClient or OkHttp to issue HTTP requests.
Accordingly, a matching brave integration must be added to the classpath:

* `io.zipkin.brave:brave-okhttp`
* `io.zipkin.brave:brave-apache-http-interceptors`

The `BraveModule` then takes care of the integration and will create a client span
for each request.

On the server-side, `BraveModule` creates a local span for each accessed repository.
Every request triggers one or more repository accesses (depending on whether
relations are included). Note however that `BraveModule` does not setup tracing
for incoming requests. That is the purpose of the JAX-RS/servlet integration of Brave.

Have a look at the Spring boot example application to see the `BraveModule` in use
together with a log reporter writing the output to console.


anchor:security_module[]

## Security Module

This is an module that intercepts all repository requests and performs role-based access
control. Have a look at the `SecurityModule` and the related `SecurityConfig` class.
A setup can looks as follows:


[source]
.SecurityModuleIntTest.java
----
include::../../../../crnk-security/src/test/java/io/crnk/security/SecurityModuleIntTest.java[tags=setup]
----

The security module is a bit more advanced than the more typical `@RolesAllowed` annotation. As such the
configuration is not done trough annotations, but with the `SecurityConfig` object where rules specify
which resources and methods are available to users. A rule can grant access for role to a single or
all resources for a given set of methods. Those rules are then applied in various contexts:

- Accesses to repositories for checked (for `GET`, `POST`, `PATCH` and `DELETE` requests).
- Both resources repository and relationship repositories are checked. For the later access to the
  return type is checked (TODO consider checking the source as well).
- A request may span multiple repository accesses in case of inclusions with the `include` parameter. In this
  case every access is checked individually.
- Relationship fields to resources the user is not authorized to see are omitted from results and can also
  not be modified.
- `HomeModule` and `MetaModule` show only resources the user is authorized to see. In case of the `MetaModule`
  the `MetaAttribute` and `MetaResource` show also information about what can be read, inserted, updated and
  deleted.
- `ResourcePermission` is added to the response as meta-data to inform the client about the authorized methods.
- (soon) Query parameters like filters, sort and inclusions are checked against unauthorized access to
  related resources.

Internally the security module makes use of `ResourceFilter` to perform this task. It is quite simple to
add further custom behavior. Have a look at the module development chapter for this.

The security module further serializes javax.security
authorization and authentication exceptions. As such it is also recommended to be
used by CrnkClient.

Future work:

- Authorized access to fields.
- Check query parameters.


anchor:meta_module[]

## Meta Module

This is a module that exposes the internal workings of Crnk as JSON API repositories.
It lets you browse the set of available resources, their types, their attributes, etc. For example,
Crnk UI make use of the meta module to implement auto-completing of input fields.

NOTE: There is currently no JSON API standard for meta data. There are more
general formats like Swagger and ALPS. At some point those might be supported as
well (probably rather the later than the former). One
can view them to be complementary to the `MetaModule` as the later
is exactly tailored towards JSON API, such as the accessability as regular
JSON API (meta) repository and data structures matching the standard. Most likely,
any future standard implementation will built up on the information from the
`MetaModule`.

A setup can look as follows:

[source]
----
		MetaModule metaModule = MetaModule.create();
		metaModule.addMetaProvider(new ResourceMetaProvider());
----

To learn more about the set of available resources, have a look at the `MetaElement` class and all its subclasses. Some of the
most important classes are:


[cols="15,15,70"]
|===
| Path              		| Implementation            | Description
| `/meta/element`			| `MetaElement` 			| Base class implemented by any meta element.
| `/meta/type`				| `MetaType` 				| Base class implemented by any meta type element.
| `/meta/primitiveType`		| `MetaPrimitiveType` 		| Represents primitive types like Strings and Integers.
| `/meta/arrayType`			| `MetaArrayType` 			| Represents an array type.
| `/meta/listType`			| `MetaListType` 			| Represents an list type.
| `/meta/setType`			| `MetaSetType` 			| Represents an set type.
| `/meta/mapType`			| `MetaMapType` 			| Represents an map type.
| `/meta/dataObject`		| `MetaDataObject`   		| Base type for any object holding data, like
																			 JPA entities or JSON API resources.
| `/meta/attribute`			| `MetaAttribute` 			| Represents an attribute of a `MetaDataObject`.
| `/meta/resource`		 	| `MetaResource`   			| JSON API resource representation extending `MetaDataObject`.
| `/meta/resourceRepository`| `MetaResourceRepository` 	| JSON API repository representation holding resources.
|===

A `MetaResource` looks like:


[source]
----
{
    "id" : "io.crnk.example.springboot.domain.model.Project",
    "type" : "meta/resource",
    "attributes" : {
      "name" : "Project",
      "resourceType" : "projects"
    },
    "relationships" : {
      "parent" : {
        ...
      },
      "interfaces" : {
        ...
      },
      "declaredKeys" : {
        ...
      },
      "children" : {
        ...
      },
      "declaredAttributes" : {
        ...
      },
      "subTypes" : {
        ...
      },
      "attributes" : {
        ...
      },
      "superType" : {
        ...
      },
      "elementType" : {
        ...
      },
      "primaryKey" : {
        ...
      }
    }
  }
----



A `MetaAttribute` looks like:

[source]
----
{
    "id" : "io.crnk.example.springboot.domain.model.Project.name",
    "type" : "meta/resourceField",
    "attributes" : {
      "filterable" : true,
      "nullable" : true,
      "lazy" : false,
      "association" : false,
      "primaryKeyAttribute" : false,
      "sortable" : true,
      "version" : false,
      "insertable" : true,
      "meta" : false,
      "name" : "name",
      "updatable" : true,
      "links" : false,
      "derived" : false,
      "lob" : false,
      "cascaded" : false
    },
    "relationships" : {
      "parent" : {
        ...
      },
      "children" : {
        ...
      },
      "oppositeAttribute" : {
        ...
      },
      "type" : {
        ...
      }
    }
  }
----


anchor:home_module[]

## Home Module

The `HomeModule` provides an implementation for https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-nottingham-json-home-06[JSON Home]. It allows
you to obtain a list of available repositories when accessing the parent page of your repositories (typically `/api`).


[source]
----
		HomeModule metaModule = HomeModule.create();
		...
----

The module is currently in an incubator stage. In the Spring Boot example
applications it looks like:


[source]
----
{
  "resources" : {
    "tag:schedule" : {
      "href" : "/schedule/"
    },
    "tag:tasks" : {
      "href" : "/tasks/"
    },
    "tag:scheduleDto" : {
      "href" : "/scheduleDto/"
    },
    "tag:meta/collectionType" : {
      "href" : "/meta/collectionType/"
    },
    "tag:projects" : {
      "href" : "/projects/"
    },
     "tag:meta/resource" : {
	  "href" : "/meta/resource/"
	},
	"tag:meta/attribute" : {
	  "href" : "/meta/attribute/"
	},
	...
  }
}
----


anchor:operations_module[]

## Operations Module

By its nature RESTful applications are limited to the insertion, update and deletion of single resources. As such, developers
have to design resources accordingly while having to consider aspects like transaction handling and atomicity. It is not
uncommon to combine multiple data objects on the server-side and expose it as single resource to clients. It is a simple
approach, but can also mean quite a substantial overhead when having to implement potentially redudant repositories.
Furthermore, things like validation handling, relationships and supporting complex object graphs can get tricky when a single
resource starts holding complex object graphs again.

For all the before mentioned reason support for http://jsonpatch.com/[jsonpatch.com] is provided. It allows to send multiple
insertions, updates and deletions with a single request and provides the results for each such executed operation.
Note that numerous attempts and discussions have taken place and are still ongoing to establish a common JSON API standard,
but that does not seem to make much progress. With  http://jsonpatch.com/[jsonpatch.com] there is already an estabilished
standard that fits well for many use cases.

The implementation is provided as `OperationsModule` and the setup looks like:


[source]
----
		OperationsModule operationsModule = OperationsModule.create();
		...
----

Further filters can be applied to intercept incoming requests. Typically applications will make use of that to start a new
transaction spanning all requests. This looks as follows:

[source]
.AbstractOperationsTest.java
----
include::../../../../crnk-operations/src/test/java/io/crnk/operations/AbstractOperationsTest.java[tags=transaction]
----

There is further an operations client implementation that works along the regular JSON API client implementation:

[source]
.OperationsPostTest.java
----
include::../../../../crnk-operations/src/test/java/io/crnk/operations/OperationsPostTest.java[tags=client]
----

The current limitations of the implementation are:

- So far does not support bulk `GET` operations.
- Does so far not support bulk update of relationships.

With support for `POST`, `PATCH` and `DELETE` operations the most important building blocks should be in place.
The limitations are expected to be addressed at some point as well, contributions welcomed.


## UI Module

The UI module makes `crnk-ui` accessible trough the module system. It allows to browse and edit all the repositories
and resources. The setup looks like:

[source]
----
		UIModule operationsModule = UIModule.create(new UIModuleConfig());
		...
----

By default the user interface is accessible from the `/browse/` directory next to all the repositories.
Have a look at the Spring Boot example application to see a working example.

This module is currently in incubation. Please provide feedback.

An example from the Spring Boot example application looks like:
