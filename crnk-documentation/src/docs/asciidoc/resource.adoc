# Resource

A resource as defined by JSON API holds the actual data. The engine part of `crnk-core` is agnostic to how such resources are
actually
implemented (see the architecture and modules chapters). This chapter gives information of the most common way using
annotations provided by `crnk-core`.


## JsonApiResource

It is the most important annotation which defines a resource. It requires type parameter to be defined that is used to form a URLs and type field in passed JSONs. According to JSON API standard, the name defined in type can be either plural or singular

The example below shows a sample class which contains a definition of a resource.

[source]
----
  @JsonApiResource(type = "tasks")
  public class Task {
    // fields, getters and setters
  }
----


## JsonApiId

Defines a field which will be used as an identifier of a resource.
Each resource requires this annotation to be present on a field which type implements `Serializable` or is of primitive type.

The example below shows a sample class which contains a definition of a field which contains an identifier.

[source]
----
  @JsonApiResource(type = "tasks")
  public class Task {
    @JsonApiId
    private Long id;

    // fields, getters and setters
  }
----


## JsonApiRelation

Indicates an association to either a single value or collection of resources. The type of such fields
must be a valid resource.

The example below shows a sample class which contains this kind of relationship.


[source]
----
  @JsonApiResource(type = "tasks")
  public class Task {

    // ID field

    @JsonApiRelation(lookUp=LookupIncludeBehavior.AUTOMATICALLY_WHEN_NULL,serialize=SerializeType.ONLY_ID)
    private Project project;

    // fields, getters and setters
  }
----


The optional `serialize` parameter specifies how the association should be serialized when making a request.
There are two things to consider. Whether related resources should be added to the `include` section of the
response document. And whether the id of related resources should be serialized along with the resource
in the corresponding `relationships.[name].data` section. Either `LAZY`, `ONLY_ID` or `EAGER` can be specified:

- `LAZY` only serializes the ID and does the inclusion if explicitly requested by the `include` URL parameter. This is the default.
- `ONLY_ID` always serializes the ID, but does only to an inclusion  if explicitly requested by the `include` URL parameter.
- `EAGER` always both serializes the ID and does an inclusion.

There are two possibilities of how related resources are fetched. Either the requested repository directly
returns related resources with the returned resources. Or Crnk can take-over that
work by doing nested calls to the corresponding `RelationshipRepositoryV2` implementations. The behavior
is controlled by the optional `lookUp` parameter. There are three options:

- 'NONE' makes the requested repository responsible for returning related resources. This is the default.
- 'AUTOMATICALLY_WHEN_NULL' will let Crnk lookup related resources if not already done by the requested repository.
- 'AUTOMATICALLY_ALWAYS' will force Crnk to always lookup related resource regardless whether it is already done by the requested repository.



## JsonApiMetaInformation

Field or getter annotated with `JsonApiMetaInformation` are marked to carry a `MetaInformation` implementation.
See http://jsonapi.org/format/#document-meta for more information about meta data. Example:

[source]
----
	@JsonApiResource(type = "projects")
	public class Project {

		...

		@JsonApiMetaInformation
		private ProjectMeta meta;

		public static class ProjectMeta implements MetaInformation {

			private String value;

			public String getValue() {
				return value;
			}

			public void setValue(String value) {
				this.value = value;
			}
		}
	}
----



## JsonApiLinksInformation

Field or getter annotated with `JsonApiLinksInformation` are marked to carry a `LinksInformation` implementation.
See http://jsonapi.org/format/#document-links for more information about linking. Example:


[source]
----
	@JsonApiResource(type = "projects")
	public class Project {

		...

		@JsonApiLinksInformation
		private ProjectLinks links;

		public static class ProjectLinks implements MetaInformation {

			private String value;

			public String getValue() {
				return value;
			}

			public void setValue(String value) {
				this.value = value;
			}
		}
	}

## Jackson annotations

Crnk comes with (partial) support for Jackson annotations. Currently supported are:

[cols="30,70"]
|===
| Annotation           		| Description

| `@JsonIgnore`
| Excludes a given attribute from serialization.

| `@JsonProperty.value`
| Renames an attribute during serialization.

| `@JsonProperty.access`
| Specifies whether an object can be read and/or written.

|===

Support for more annotations will be added in the future. PRs welcomed.
