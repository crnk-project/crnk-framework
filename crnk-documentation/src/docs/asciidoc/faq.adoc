How to do Cors with Crnk?::
  In most (if not all) cases Cors should be setup in the underlying
  integration, like with the Servlet-API or as JAX-RS filter and
  not within Crnk itself. This allows to make use of the native
  Cors mechanisms of an integration and to share Cors handling with
  the other parts of the application.

Is Swagger supported by Crnk?::
  Crnk comes with an experimental generator that will create an Open API-compatible
  specification. For more general information about the benefits of a more opinionated
  specification like JSON:API see http://www.crnk.io/related/.

How can the serialization of Java 8 date and time data types be customized?::
  This is entirely in the hands of Jackson and not related to Crnk. A custom `JsonDeserializer`
  and `JsonSerializer` can be implemented and registered with `ObjectMapper`.
