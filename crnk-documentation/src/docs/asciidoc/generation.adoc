# Generation

Crnk allows the generation of Typescript stubs for type-safe, client-side web development. Contributions for other
languages like iOS would be very welcomed.

## Typescript

The Typescript generator allows the generation of:

- interfaces for resources and related objects (like nested objects and enumeration types).
- interfaces for result documents (i.e. resources and any linking and meta information).
- interfaces for links information.
- interfaces for meta information.
- methods to create empty object instances.
- QueryDSL-like expression classes (see <expressions>)

Currently the generator targets the http://github.com/abdulhaq-e/ngrx-json-api[ngrx-json-api] library.
Support for other libraries/formats would be straightforward to add, contributions welcomed. A generated resource looks
like:

[source]
----
include::../../../../crnk-gen-typescript/src/test/resources/expected_schedule_without_expressions.ts[]
----

For an example have a look at the Crnk example application, see https://github.com/crnk-project/crnk-example[crnk-project/crnk-example].

Internally the generator has to make use of the running application to gather the necessary information for generation. This
approach not only supports the typical, manual implement resources and repositories manually, but also
the ones obtained through third-party modules such the JPA entities exposed by the JPA module. There are different
possibilities to do that. https://github.com/crnk-project/crnk-framework/blob/master/crnk-client-angular-ngrx/build
.gradle[crnk-client-angular-ngrx]
does such a setup manually in Gradle. Alternatively, there is a Gradle plugin taking care of the generator setup. It makes use
of the JUnit to get
the application to a running state at built-time. Currently supported are CDI and Spring-based applications.
Such a setup may look like:

[source]
----
buildscript {
	dependencies {
		classpath "io.crnk:crnk-gen-typescript:${version}"
		classpath "com.moowork.gradle:gradle-node-plugin:1.1.1"
	}
}

node {
	version = '6.9.1'
	download = true
	distBaseUrl = "${ADN_NODEJS_MIRROR_BASE_URL}/dist"
}

apply plugin: 'crnk-gen-typescript'

configurations {
	typescriptGenRuntime
}

dependencies {
	typescriptGenRuntime project(':project-to-generate-from')
}

typescriptGen{

	runtime {
		configuration = 'typescriptGenRuntime'
        spring {
        	profile = 'test'
        	configuration = 'ch.adnovum.arch.demo.management.service.ManagementApplication'
        	initializerMethod = 'someInitMethod'
        	defaultProperties['someKey'] = 'someValue'
        }
	}

	npm {
		packageVersion = '0.0.1'
		packageName = '@crnk/example-api'
		description = 'example API to access example backend'
		gitRepository = 'https://.../bitbucket/scm/crnk/example.git'
		license = 'MIT'
		// packagingEnabled = false
		// outputDir = ...
	}

	includes = ['resources.task']
	excludes = ['resources.project']

	forked = true

	packageMapping['resources.something'] = '@crnk/some-other-library'
	peerDependencies['ngrx-json-api'] = '>=2.2.0'
	generateExpressions = true

	// genDir = ...

}
typescriptGen.init()

The basic Gradle setup makes use of:

- the `moowork` plugin is used to to gain a `node` setup.
- `crnk-meta` is used as dependency to gather a meta model of the underlying resources (or a any other type of object
  like JPA entities). Important to know is that every object is assigned a string-based meta id. By default the
  meta id matches `resources.<resourceType>`. For example a Task resource with resource type `task` has a
  `resources.task` meta id.
- applying `crnk-gen-typescript` results in a new `assembleTypescript` task. Consumers may want to add
  that task to `assemble` as dependency.


The plugin is in need for a running application to extract the set of available resources. The `runtime` section provides
a number of possibilities how this can be achieved. Typically the simplest way to have a running application is to
run in the same manner as for testing. This can be achieved, for example, by replicating the classpath, configuration,
environment, Spring profiles, etc. Currently supported are Spring and CDI to achieve this. Please open up a ticket
if you desire to work in another environment. There are a number of properties to do that:

- `runtime.configuration` sets the Gradle configuration to use to construct a classpath. In the given example
   `typescriptGenRuntime` is used. You may also use `compile` or anything else.
- for CDI it will work out-of-the-box if Weld is found on the classpath.
- for Spring properties allow to set the Spring profile, default properties and configuration
  class to use. Optionally an `initializerMethod` can be specified that is invoked before the
  Spring application to perform further customization.

The plugin allows various further customization options:

- `packageName`, `description`, `license`, `gitRepository` are added to the generated `package.json`.
- by default the package version matches the npm version.
- `packagingEnabled`  triggers the generation of a `package.json` and `tsconfig.json` file (`true` as default).
  Useful to publish the stubs to an NPM repository for use by other projects.
  Setting it to false will result in the generation of the Typescript files only. This may be used to generate
   files directly into an existing frontend project. In this case only the `generateTypescript` task is available, there
   is no assembly taking place.
- `genDir` specifies where source files are generated to.
- `npm.outputDirectory` specifies where the compiled NPM package should be placed (`build/npm` as default).
- `generateExpressions` specifies whether QueryDSL like classes should be generated (`false` as default).
- `packageMapping` allows to specify into which libraries resources belong to. By default all resources have
  a `resources.` meta id prefix and go into the currently generated package. In the example above, all resources with a
  `something/*` resource type resp. `resources.something` meta id prefix are included from a `@crnk/some-demo-library`
  library and no longer get generated manually.
- `includes` and `excludes` allow to include and exclude resources from generation based on their meta id.
- by default the generation takes place in a forked process. Since the generator typically
  runs the application and that may not properly cleanup, it is recommended to let the
  generator fork a new process to avoid resource leakage in Gradle daemons and
  have more stable builds.
