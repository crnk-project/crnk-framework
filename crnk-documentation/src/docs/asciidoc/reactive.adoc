# Reactive Programming

WARNING: Initial support is available, but still considered (very) experimental. The implementation is expected to mature over the coming weeks. Breaking changes
  to the reactive API might be possible. The traditional API is left unchanged.

The `ReactiveModule` of `crnk-reactive` bring support for reactive programming to Crnk.
It allows to build more responsive, elastic, resilient, message-driven applications (see
https://www.reactivemanifesto.org/). https://projectreactor.io/ was chosen as library.

IMPORTANT: Traditional and reactive-style programming APIs are considered being equally important and will both be supported the coming years.

`crnk-reactive` brings along three new interfaces that act as reactive counter-parts of the traditional resource and relationship interfaces:

- `ReactiveResourceRepository`
- `ReactiveOneRelationshipRepository`
- `ReactiveManyRelationshipRepository`

The differences to the traditional ones are:

- Single and multi-valued relationships are served by different interfaces (minor cleanup, usually one or the other is necessary).
- `ResourceField` instead of a simple `String` give more detailed information about the accessed relationship.
- Most importantly, `reactor.core.publisher.Mono` is used as return type to enable reactive programming.

NOTE that:

- A potential future V3 version of the traditional interfaces will align the first two differences.
- `Mono` rather than `Flux` is used for list return types since meta and links information must be returned as well, not just a sequence of resources.
  For large number of resources, the JSON:API pagination mechanisms can be applied.
- Internally the traditional and reactive repositories are served by the same Crnk engine and share virtually all of the code base.
  The difference lies in the used `ResultFactory` implementation. `ImmediateResultFactory` is used by the traditional API. `MonoResultFactory` by
  reactive setups.

## Servlet Example

The subsequent example shows as simple reactive resource repository holding its data in-memory:

[source]
.InMemoryReactiveResourceRepository.java
----
include::../../../../crnk-test/src/main/java/io/crnk/test/mock/reactive/InMemoryReactiveResourceRepository.java[]
----

The following snipped shows how to setup the `ReactiveModule` together with `AsyncCrnkServlet` in Spring:

[source]
.ReactiveServletTestApplication.java
----
include::../../../../crnk-setup/crnk-setup-servlet/src/test/java/io/crnk/servlet/resource/ReactiveServletTestApplication.java[tags=reactive]
----

Ready-to-use integrations into Spring, Vert.x and Ratpack are planned for the near future.

## Interacting with traditional repositories

Reactive and traditional repositories work well together side-by-side and can also be used in a mixed setting, for example when requesting the inclusion
of related resources. Since the traditional repositories will block the caller, there are two mechanisms in place to remedy the issue:

1. A repository can be annotated with `ImmediateRepository`. In this case the traditional repository is marked as being non-blocking and can be safely invoked.

2. `ReactiveModule.setWorkerScheduler(...)` allows to set the scheduler to use to invoke traditional repositories. By default `Schedulers.elastic` is used where
   worker threads are spanned as necessary.

## Roadmap and Limitations

- `DocumentFilter`, `RepositoryFilter` cannot be used in a reactive setup. Reactive counter-party will be available in the near future.
- `HttpRequestContextProvider.getRequestContext` can only be used in a non-reactive setting or while the reactive request is being setup.
  `HttpRequestContextProvider.getRequestContextResult` must be used instead that makes use of the subscriber context of Reactor.
- `crnk-data-jpa` has not yet been ported yet. JDBC and JPA are blocking and require a transaction.
- Spring, Vert.x and Ratpack integrations are target for the near future.
- More testing will be necessary.

Contributions in any area welcomed.
