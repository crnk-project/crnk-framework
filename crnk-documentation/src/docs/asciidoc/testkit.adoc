# TestKit

With `crnk-testkit` is in the early stages of providing utilities to facilitate testing.
`RandomWalkLinkChecker` is a class that performs a random walk on an API endpoint by following
all the links as specified by JSON:API. It will verify that each links provides a valid
`2xx` response code. The setup looks like:

[source,java]
----
CrnkClient client = ...
HttpAdapter httpAdapter = client.getHttpAdapter();

RandomWalkLinkChecker linkChecker = new RandomWalkLinkChecker(httpAdapter);
linkChecker.setWalkLength(100);
linkChecker.addStartUrl(...)

linkChecker.performCheck();
----

More possibilities for automation in the future are to add checks for:

- paging
- filtering
- sorting
- security
- field sets
- ...
