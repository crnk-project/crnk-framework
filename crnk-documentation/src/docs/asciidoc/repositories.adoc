# Repositories

The modelled resources and relationships must be complemented by a corresponding
repository implementation. This is achieved by implementing
one of those two repository interfaces:

  * ResourceRepository for resources.
  * RelationshipRepository resp. BulkRelationshipRepository for relationships.

The repositories are used to serve `POST`, `GET`, `PATCH` and `DELETE` requests as specified by
JSON:API specification. The repository contract closely resembles the JSON:API specification. Subsequent
sections and chapters outline various possibilities to speed-up and potentially reuse existing
repository implementations.

IMPORTANT: When accessing repositories, do not forget to use the `application/vnd.api+json` content type.



anchor:resource_repository[]

## ResourceRepository

`ResourceRepository` is the main interface used to operate on resources with `POST`, `GET`, `PATCH` and `DELETE` requests.
The interface takes two generic arguments:

1. The type of a resource. Typically this is a plain Java Bean making use of the JSON:API annotations. But may also be something
  entirely different (see <<architectures> and <<modules>>). One other example is the
  `io.crnk.core.engine.document.Resource` class used to setup dynamically types repositories.
2. The type of the resourceâ€™s identifier. Typically a primitive type like `String`, `long` or `UUID`. But if necessary
  can also be a more complex type that serializes to a URL-friendly String.

The methods of `ResourceRepository` look as follows:

* `findOne(ID id, QuerySpec querySpec)`
  Search one resource with a given ID. If a resource cannot be found, a ResourceNotFoundException exception should be thrown
  that translates into a `404` HTTP error status. The returned resource must adhere to the behavior as specifies by
  the various annotations (more details in the <<resource>> chapter), most notably the inclusion of relationships as requested
  by the passed `querySpec` as long as `LookupIncludeBehavior` does not specify otherwise. More details about `QuerySpec`
  follow in subsequent sections.

* `findAll(Iterable<ID>ids, QuerySpec querySpec)`
  Allows to bulk request multiple resources, but otherwise work exactly like the preceding `findOne` method.

* `findAll(QuerySpec querySpec)`
  Search for all resources according to the passed `querySpec` including sorting, filtering, paging, field sets and inclusions.
  A `ResourceList` must be returned that carries the result resources, links information and meta information.

* `create(S resource)`
  Called by `POST` requests. The request body is deserialized and passed as `resource` parameter. The method may or may
  not have to generate an ID for the newly created resource. The request body may specify relationship data to point to
  other resources. During deserialization, those resources are looked up and the `@JsonApiRelation` annotated fields set
  accordingly. For relationships making use of `@JsonApiRelationId` annotation, only the identifier will be set without
  the resource annotation, allowing to improve for performance. The `create` method has to save those relationships, but
  it does and must not perform any changes on the related resources. For bulk inserting and updating resources, have a look
  at the <<operations_module, operations module>>. The method must return the updated resource, most notably with a valid
  identifier.


* `save(S resource)`
  Saves a resource upon a `PATCH` request. The general semantics is identical to the `create(...)` method, with two
  notable exceptions. First, resources are updated but are not allowed to be inserted.
  A `ResourceNotFoundException` must be thrown if the resource does not exist. Second, the `PATCH` request
  allows for partial updates. Internally Crnk will get the current state of a resource, patch it and pass it to this `save`
  method. A `ResourceModificationFilter` can be registered to collect information about modified fields and relationships and this way,
  for example, distinguish patched from un-patched fields.



* `delete(ID id)`
  Removes a resource identified by id parameter. A `ResourceNotFoundException` must be thrown if the resource does not exist.

The ResourceRepositoryBase is a base class that takes care of some boiler-plate, like implementing findOne with findAll. An
implementation can then look as simple as:

[source]

(the basic Spring boot example from crnk-framework, not the dedicated full-blown one from crnk-example).

----

You may notice that:

- links get automatically created.
- `totalResourceCount` and pagination links are added to the response if the `page` parameter is applied.
- related `project` gets automatically resolved from `projectId`. No relationship repository is implemented here
  due to the use of `@JsonApiRelationId` (see below).
- the response gets automatically truncated with the `fields` parameter, ideally suited for bandwidth sensitive applications.
- multiple values can be separated by comma, typically repositories will then use an `OR` and accept and resource matching any of the values.

This is one small example that *shows the power of native resource-oriented REST libraries*. Implementing a similar API with more
classical REST libraries can be a substantial amount of work.

There is further a `ReadOnlyResourceRepositoryBase` base class that does not allow to override
the create, delete and update methods. `crnk-meta` accordingly reports
insertable, updateable, deltable for such repositories as false.







## Query parameters with QuerySpec

Crnk passes JSON:API query parameters to repositories trough a QuerySpec parameter. It holds
request parameters like sorting and filtering specified by JSON:API. The subsequent
sections will provide a number of example.

NOTE: Not everything is specified by JSON:API. For some request parameters only recommendations
are provided as different applications are likely to be in need of different semantics and
implementations. For this reason the engine part in `crnk-core` makes use of `QueryAdapter` and allows implementations other than
QuerySpec (like the legacy `QueryParams`). The mapping of HTTP request parameters to QuerySpec and back
is implemented by <<urlmapper,`QuerySpecUrlMapper`>> that may can also be extended, customized or replaced.

For example showing its use URLs also have a look at the <<resource_repository,ResourceRepository>> section.


### API

The QuerySpec API looks like (further setters available as well):

[source]
----
	public class QuerySpec {
		public <T> List<T> apply(Iterable<T> resources){...}

		public Long getLimit() {...}

		public long getOffset() {...}

		public PagingSpec getPagingSpec() {...}

		public List<FilterSpec> getFilters() {...}

		public List<SortSpec> getSort() {...}

		public List<IncludeFieldSpec> getIncludedFields() {...}

		public List<IncludeRelationSpec> getIncludedRelations() {...}

		public QuerySpec getQuerySpec(Class<?> resourceClass) {...}

		...
	}
----

There are `Spec` class for all major features:

- `FilterSpec`
- `SortSpec`
- `IncludeFieldSpec`
- `IncludeRelationSpec`
- `PagingSpec`

More information is given in the subsequent sections.

QuerySpec provides a method `apply` that allows in-memory sorting, filtering and paging
on any `java.util.Collection`. It is useful for testing, mocking and on smaller datasets to keep
the implementation of a repository as simple as possible.




anchor:filtering[]

### Basic Filtering

NOTE: The JSON:API specification does not a mandate a specific filtering semantic. Instead
it provides a recommendation that comes by default with Crnk. Depending on the data store
in use, application may choose to extend or replace that default implementation by extending or
replacing `DefaultQuerySpecUrlMapper`.

Resource filtering can be achieved by providing parameters which start with `filter`:

* `GET /tasks?filter[name]=Super task` to filter by name with the default `EQ` operator.
* `GET /tasks?filter[name][EQ]=Super task` to filter by name with the `EQ` operator.
* `GET /tasks?filter[name][EQ]=SomeTask,OtherTask` to filter by multiple `OR`-ed values.
* `GET /tasks?filter[name][LIKE]=Super%` to filter by name with the `LIKE` operator using `%` as wildcard.
* `GET /tasks?filter[address.plz][EQ]=Super task` to filter by attribute `name` within a structured or related attributes `address`.
* `GET /tasks?filter[address.city][EQ]=Super task` to filter by attribute `city` within a structured or related attributes `address`.
* `GET /tasks?filter[name]=Super task&filter[dueDate][GT]=2015-10-01`
* `GET /tasks?filter[name]=null` to filter by `name` being equals `null`.
* `GET /tasks?filter[tasks][name]=Super task` is the longer version of `/tasks/?filter[name]=Super task` where the `tasks` type is explicitly stated.
  See the subsequent <<inclusion>> section how to use this to perform filtering of related resources.

A filter parameter is represented by a `FilterSpec`. It holds the path to the attribute,
the operator and the filter value. The attribute specifies what gets filtered. The operator
specifies how it is filtered. And the value specifies after what should be filtered.

An example looks like:

[source]
----
FilterSpec filterSpec = PathSpec.of("person", "address", "city").filter(FilterOperator.EQ, "Zurich");
Filterspec filterSpec = new FilterSpec(PathSpec.of("person.address.city"), FilterOperator.NEQ, "Zurich");
----

The filter value  `FilterSpec.value` is strongly typed. Typically (by default) it is assumed
that the filter value matches the attribute type and Crnk will attempt to parse passed String-based
filter value accordingly. There are exceptions, for example, the LIKE filter operator always requires
the filter value to be a string to support wildcards for not just String types, but also Enums
and other types (the underlying `FilterOperator` implementation can specify this with `getFilterType(...)`).

Operators within `FilterSpec` are represented by the `FilterOperator` class.
By default, QuerySpec uses the `EQ` operator if no operator was provided.
Crnk comes with a set of default filters:

[cols="1,3", options="header"]
|===
|Name
|Descriptor

|`EQ`
|equals operator where values match exactly.

|`NEQ`
|not equals where values do not match.

|`LIKE`
|where the value matches the specified pattern. It is usually
 not case-sensitive and makes use of `%` as wildclard, but
 may different depending on the underlying implementation.

|`LT`
|lower than the specified value

|`LE`
|lower than or equals the specified value

|`GT`
|greater than the specified value

|`GE`
|greater than or equals the specified value
|===

By default the filtering process is quite opinionated and should fit many typical patterns.
But there also many possibilities to customize its behavior to the use case at hand.
For this purpose <<CrnkBoot>> offers access to the `DefaultQuerySpecUrlMapper` with `CrnkBoot.getUrlMapper()`
and `TypeParser` with `CrnkBoot.getModuleRegistry().getTypeParser()` (or `ModuleContext`).
For example:

- `TypeParser` allows to register and override the parsing of Strings to other classes.
  By default it has has built-in parsers for various JRE classes. Custom `StringMapper`
   can be registered. As fallback it will make use of the `ObjectMapper` of Jackson
   (which in most cases will be also the default).
- `DefaultQuerySpecUrlMapper.setIgnoreParseExceptions(...)` allows to ignore if parsing
  of a filter value fails. In this case the filter value is left as String and it is
  assumed the repository itself will take care of the parsing.
- `CrnkBoot.setAllowUnknownAttributes` ignore unknown attributes and passes them as is to
  the repositories to handle them. More information in the <<properties>> section.
- The application is free to implements custom `FilterOperator`. Next to the name
  a `matches` method can be implemented to support in-memory filtering
  with `QuerySpec.apply`. Otherwise, it is up to the repository implementation
  to handle the various filter operators; usually by translating them
  to datastore-native query expressions. Custom operators can be registered
  with `DefaultQuerySpecUrlMapper.addSupportedOperator(..)`. The default operator can be
  overridden by setting `DefaultQuerySpecUrlMapper.setDefaultOperator(...)`.
  For more information see  <<urlmapper,`QuerySpecUrlMapper`>>.

anchor:nested_filtering[]

### Nested Filtering

WARNING: This feature is experimental. Please provide feedback.

The url patterns from the previous section allow to `AND` multiple filter conditions. For scenarios where
this is insufficient, it is also possible to specify more complex filter specifications through JSON.
The subsequent example filters projects by either their `name` being equals `Great Project` or its `id`
being smaller or equals 122.

[source]
----
http://127.0.0.1:8080/projects?filter={"OR": {"name": "Great Project", "LE": {"id": 122}}}
----

The following rules apply:

- JSON field names matching an operator can be used in two different ways: to setup arbitrary nesting
  of `AND`, `OR`, `NOT` or to specify an operator for field, name pair like `{"id": 122}`.
- JSON field names matching a resource field name can also be used in two different ways: to filter the
  attribute by the specified value or to setup nested attributes.

Some further examples:

1. To require a single attribute to equal a value:

  {"name": "test"}

2. To require a single attribute to equal a value from within a set:

  {"id": [12, 13, 14]}

3. To filter by multiple attributes with the `OR` operator:

  { "OR": [ {"id": [12, 13, 14]}, {"completed": "true"} ] }

4. To filter by multiple attributes with the `AND` operator:

  { "AND": [ {"id": [12, 13, 14]}, {"completed": "true"} ] }
+
or more simply:

  {"id": [12, 13, 14], "completed": "true" }

5. To nest `AND`, `OR`, `NOT` operators:

  {"name": "Great Task", "OR": {"id": 122, "name": "Other Task"}}

6. To filter an attribute `name` on relationship `assignee`:

  {"assignee": {"name": "test"}}





anchor:sorting[]

### Sorting

Sorting information for the resources can be achieved by providing `sort` parameter.

`GET /tasks?sort=name,-shortName`
`GET /tasks?sort=assignee.firstName,assignee.lastName`

- Sorting parameters are represented by `SortSpec` within `QuerySpec` similar to `FilterSpec` above.
- `-` is used to denote to sort in descending order.

An example in Java looks like:

[source]
----
SortSpec sortSpec = PathSpec.of("person", "address", "city").sort(Direction.ASC);
SortSpec sortSpec = new SortSpec(PathSpec.of("person.address.city"), Direction.DESC);
----

anchor:pagination[]

### Pagination


#### Offset/Limit Paging

Crnk comes by default with support for offset/limit paging:

`GET /tasks?page[offset]=0&page[limit]=10`

The parameters are then available with `QuerySpec.getPaging(type)` or the shortcuts `QuerySpec.getLimit` and `QuerySpec.getOffset`.


#### Number/Size Paging

Support for number/size-based paging can be enabled by registering the `NumberSizePagingBehavior` in one of two ways:

- register `NumberSizePagingBehavior.createModule()`
- register `NumberSizePagingBehavior` directly to service discovery.

Paging parameters can then look like:

`GET /tasks?page[number]=1&page[size]=10`

Internally Crnk is able to translate between offset/limit and number/size-based paging. If
a repository has been implemented with offset/limit paging, it works equally well when number/size paging is used.
The conversion takes place automatically when invoking `QuerySpec.getPaging(desiredPagingType)`.


#### Pagination Links

JSON:API specifies `first`, `previous`, `next` and `last` links (see http://jsonapi.org/format/#fetching-pagination).
The `PagedLinksInformation` interface provides a Java representation of those links that can be implemented and returned
by repositories along with the result data. There is a default implementation named `DefaultPagedLinksInformation`.

There are two ways to let Crnk compute pagination links automatically:

1. The repository returns meta information implementing `PagedMetaInformation`. With this interface the total
   number of (potentially filtered) resources is passed to Crnk, which in turn allows the computation of the links.
2. The repository returns meta information implementing `HasMoreResourcesMetaInformation`. This interface
   only specifies whether further resources are available after the currently requested resources. This
   lets Crnk compute all except the `last` link.

Note that for both approaches the repository has to return either no links or links information implementing
`PagedLinksInformation`. If the links are already set, then the computation will be skipped.

The potential benefit of the second over the first approach is that it might be easier to just
determine whether more resources are available rather than counting all resources.
This is typically achieved by querying `limit + 1` resources.

#### Custom strategies

`OffsetLimitPagingBehavior` and `OffsetLimitPagingSpec` and `NumberSizePagingBehavior` and `NumberSizePagingSpec`
are two implementations of `PagingBehavior` and `PagingSpec`. Applications are free to add further implementations
or replace the existing ones. In order to do so, you would have to perform the following actions:

* Provide an instance of a custom `PagingBehavior` implementation.
* Register the `PagingBehavior` to Spring. There are two possibilities:
** through the service discovery mechanism like CDI or Spring.
** through a new module with:

   SimpleModule module = new SimpleModule("myPaging");
   module.addPaginationBehavior(new MyPaginationBehavior());


* Make use of the new pagination strategy for your resources:
** by default the first pagination behavior will become the default for all resources.
** by explicitly specify which resource makes use of which paging specification with
  <<jsonApiResourcePagingBehavior,@JsonApiResource.pagingSpec>>.

For examples have a look at the `OffsetLimitPagingBehavior` and `OffsetLimitPagingSpec` or
`NumberSizePagingBehavior` and `NumberSizePagingSpec` implementations.

There is the possibility for a `PagingBehavior` to serve multiple `PagingSpec`. This is used, for example,
by `NumberSizePagingBehavior` to translate `number` and `size` to `offset` and `limit` for repositories
that are based on `OffsetLimitPagingSpec`.


### Sparse Fieldsets

Information about fields to include in the response can be achieved by providing `fields` parameter:

`GET /tasks?fields=name,description`


anchor:inclusion[]

### Inclusion of Related Resources

Information about relationships to include in the response can be achieved by providing an `include` parameter. Examples:

* `GET /tasks?include=project` performs an inclusion of `project`.
* `GET /tasks?include=assignee,project` performs an inclusion of `project` and `assignee`.
* `GET /tasks?include=assignee.address` performs a nested inclusion of `assignee` within `owner`.
* `GET /tasks/1?include=project` performs an inclusion of `project` for the task with id `1`.

It is not only possible to include related resources, but also to use all other query features like sorting and filtering. In this
case the parameters must be prefixed with the resource type such as `[project]` to sort and filter the related project:

`GET /tasks?include=project&sort[project]=name&filter[project][name]=someProject`

It is important to note that the requested main resource is NOT affected by `[project]`. To rather sort all tasks by the related project
make use of:

`GET /tasks?include=project&sort=project.name&filter[project.name]=someProject`

Internally QuerySpec holds the value for a given resource type. If parameters for other resource types, multiple
QuerySpec instances are used. Repositories are then accessed with the QuerySpec matching the repository.
The QuerySpec for a particular resource type can be obtained with `QuerySpec.getRelatedSpec(Class)` on the root QuerySpec.



anchor:urlmapper[]

### URL Mapping

The mapping of request parameters to QuerySpec and back is implemented by `QuerySpecUrlMapper`.
With `DefaultQuerySpecUrlMapper` there is a default implementation that follows the JSON:API
specification and recommendations and introduces some further defaults as documented
in the previous sections (like the filter operators) where the recommendations
do not go far enough. The used `QuerySpecUrlMapper` can be obtained
from `CrnkBoot.getUrlMapper()` and `CrnkClient.getUrlMapper()`. Matching setter allow to
setup a custom implementation.

`DefaultQuerySpecUrlMapper` comes with a number of customization options:

* `setAllowUnknownAttributes(boolean)`
	`DefaultQuerySpecUrlMapper` validates all passed parameters against the domain model and fails
	if one of the attributes is unknown. This flag allows to disable that check in case this should be necessary.

* `setAllowUnknownParameters(boolean)`
	`DefaultQuerySpecUrlMapper` validates all passed parameters to be one of the following types: `filter`, `sort`, `page`, `fields` or `include`.
	In case of any custom query parameter `ParametersDeserializationException` will be thrown.
	This flag allows to disable that check and ignore any unknown ones.

* `setIgnoreParseExceptions(boolean)`
	`DefaultQuerySpecUrlMapper` attempts to convert all filter parameters to their proper type based on the
	attribute type to be filtered. In some scenarios like dates this behavior may be undesirable as applications
	introduce expressions like 'now`. Enabling this flag will let `DefaultQuerySpecDeserializer` ignore
	such values and provide them as `String` within `FilterSpec`.

* `setEnforceDotPathSeparator(boolean)`
	DefaultQuerySpecUrlMapper makes use of a dotted URL convetion like
	 `http://.../resource?filter[task][project.name]=myProject`. But for historic reasons it also
	 accepts `http://.../resource?filter[task][project][name]=myProject`. The later is not recommended
	 to be used anymore because  there is danger of introducing ambiguity when resources and attributes
	 are named equally. By enabling this flag, support for the historic format gets removed and no
	 ambiguity can occur. While not being the default, it is recommended to do so. With the next
	 major version, the default will change.


* `setMapJsonNames`
    Whether to map JSON to Java names for `QuerySpec`. Enabled by default. Typically JSON and Java names are equal, but, for example,
    fields can be renamed with the `@JsonProperty` annotation.


* `addSupportedOperator`
    Adds a new `FilterOperator`. See <<filtering>> for more information.

* `setDefaultOperator`
    Sets the default `FilterOperator`. See <<filtering>> for more information.

Some of those methods are also available from some of the integrations like `CrnkFeature` for convenience.





anchor:relationshipRepository[]

## Relationship Repositories

IMPORTANT: Before getting started with the development of relationship repositories, familiarize yourself
with <<jsonApiRelation,@JsonApiRelation>>. In various scenarios, a custom implementation is unnecessary!
In many cases `@JsonApiRelationId` provides the simplest solution to a relationship. Any opposite
relationship can then make use of `@JsonApiRelation.mappedBy`.

Each relationship defined in Crnk (annotation @JsonApiRelation) must have a relationship repository
defined implementing `OneRelationshipRepository` or `ManyRelationshipRepository`. The
repository implements the methods necessary to work with a relationship. They provide the methods to work
with single-valued and multi-valued relationships:


* `getMatcher()`
  Provides a  `RelationshipMatcher` instance that specifies which relationships it is able provide.
  It can match against source and target types and fields in any combination. Note that this
  is a default method that access the legacy `getSourceResourceClass` and `getTargetResourceClass`
  by default. Implementation of those methods can be omitted if a matcher is available.

* `setRelation(T source, D_ID targetId, String fieldName)`
  Sets a resource defined by targetId to a field fieldName in an instance source. If no value is to be set, null value is passed.

* `setRelations(T source, Iterable<D_ID> targetIds, String fieldName)`
  Sets resources defined by targetIds to a field fieldName in an instance source. This is a all-or-nothing operation, that is no partial relationship updates are passed. If no values are to be set, empty Iterable is passed.

* `addRelations(T source, Iterable<D_ID> targetIds, String fieldName)`
  Adds relationships to a list of relationships.

* `removeRelations(T source, Iterable<D_ID> targetIds, String fieldName)`
  Removes relationships from a list of relationships.

* `findOneRelations(Collection<T_ID> sourceIds, String fieldName, QuerySpec querySpec)`
  Finds the single-valued relationship for sources with the ids `sourceIds`.

* `findManyRelations(Collection<T_ID> sourceIds, String fieldName, QuerySpec querySpec)`
  Finds the multi-valued relationship for sources with the ids `sourceIds`.

All of the methods in this interface have a `fieldName` as last parameter in case multiple fields are served
by the same repository. The `findOneRelations` and `findManyRelations` methods gain access to the source
class through `querySpec.getResourceClass`, whereas the other methods directly obtain a `source` instance.


### Example


[source]
.HistoryRelationshipRepository
----
include::../../../../crnk-integration-examples/spring-boot-example/src/main/java/io/crnk/example/springboot/domain/repository/HistoryRelationshipRepository.java[tag=docs]
----


### RelationshipMatcher

With `RelationshipRepository.getMatcher()` one has a lot of flexibility about which kind of relationships a repository is
serving. Rules can look like:

[source]
.RelationshipMatcherTest
----
new RelationshipMatcher().rule().source("projects").add().matches(field)
new RelationshipMatcher().rule().target(Task.class).add().matches(field)
new RelationshipMatcher().rule().target(Tasks.class).add().matches(field)
new RelationshipMatcher().rule().field("tasks").add().matches(field)
new RelationshipMatcher().rule().oppositeField("project").add().matches(field)
----

One can implement, for example, a history relationship repository that introduces a history relationship for every other resource
as done in the example from the previous section.


### Self and Related Links

The JSON:API specification from http://jsonapi.org/format/#fetching-relationships
mandates two relationship links:

- `"self": "http://example.com/articles/1/relationships/author"`
- `"related": "http://example.com/articles/1/author"`

While the `related` link returns full resources, the `self` link only returns the `type` and `id`:

[source]
----
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/vnd.api+json

{
  "links": {
    "self": "/articles/1/relationships/author",
    "related": "/articles/1/author"
  },
  "data": {
    "type": "people",
    "id": "12"
  }
----

Behind the scenes, Crnk invokes the same relationship repository implementation , but the QuerySpec will specify whether only the identifier is required through
the `includedFields` property.


### ForwardingRelationshipRepository

NOTE: Also have a look at <<jsonApiRelation,@JsonApiRelation.repositoryBehavior>> before getting started to use
this base class.

In many cases, relationship operations can be mapped back to resource repository operations. Making the need
for a custom relationship repository implementation redundant. `@JsonApiRelationId` fields is one example
where Crnk will take care of this automatically. But there are many other scenarios where application apply
similar techniques. A findManyTargets request might can be
served by filtering the target repository. Or a relationship can be set by invoking the save operation
on either the source or target resource repository (usually you want to save on the single-valued side).
The `ForwardingRelationshipRepository` is a base class that takes care of exactly such use cases.
`ForwardingRelationshipRepository` knows to `ForwardingDirection`: `OWNER` and `OPPOSITE`. The former forwards requests
to the resource repository of the owning side of a relationship, while the later forwards to the opposite side.
`ForwardingDirection` is set separately for `GET` and modification operations (`POST`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`).

An example to create such a repository looks like:

[source]
----
RelationshipMatcher taskProjectMatcher = new RelationshipMatcher();
taskProjectMatcher.rule().source(Task.class).target(Project.class).add();

new ForwardingRelationshipRepository(
  Task.class, taskProjectMatcher, ForwardingDirection.OWNER, ForwardingDirection.OWNER
);
----

Note that to access the opposite side for `GET` operations, relations must be set up bidirectionally with the
`opposite` attribute (to allow filtering in that direction):

[source]
----
	@JsonApiResource(type = "tasks")
	public class Task {

		@JsonApiRelation(opposite = "tasks", lookUp = LookupIncludeBehavior.AUTOMATICALLY_WHEN_NULL)
		private Project project;

	    ...
	}
----


## ResourceList

ResourceRepository and RelationshipRepository return lists of type ResourceList. The ResourceList can carry, next
to the actual resources, also meta and links information:

* `getLinks()`
	Gets the links information attached to this lists.

* `getMeta()`
	Gets the meta information attached to this lists.

* `getLinks(Class<L> linksClass)`
	Gets the links information of the given type attached to this lists. If the given type is not found, null is returned.

* `getMeta(Class<M> metaClass)`
	Gets the meta information of the given type attached to this lists. If the given type is not found, null is returned.

There is a default implementation named DefaultResourceList. To gain type-safety, improved readability and crnk-client support,
application may provide a custom implementation extending ResourceListBase:

[source]
----
	class ScheduleList extends ResourceListBase<Schedule, ScheduleListMeta, ScheduleListLinks> {

	}

	class ScheduleListLinks implements LinksInformation {

		public String name = "value";

		...
	}

	class ScheduleListMeta implements MetaInformation {

		public String name = "value";

		...
	}
----

This implementation can then be added to a repository interface declaration
and used by both servers and clients:

[source]
----
	public interface ScheduleRepository extends ResourceRepository<Schedule, Long> {

		@Override
		public ScheduleList findAll(QuerySpec querySpec);

	}
----





## Error Handling

Processing errors in Crnk can be handled by throwing an exception and providing
a corresponding exception mapper which defines mapping to a proper JSON:API error response.


### Throwing an exception...

Here is an example of throwing an Exception in the code:

[source]
----
  if (somethingWentWrong()) {
    throw new SampleException("errorId", "Oops! Something went wrong.")
  }
----

Sample exception is nothing more than a simple runtime exception:

[source]
----
  public class SampleException extends RuntimeException {

    private final String id;
    private final String title;

    public ExampleException(String id, String title) {
      this.id = id;
      this.title = title;
    }

    public String getId() {
      return id;
    }

    public String getTitle() {
      return title;
    }
  }
----

### ...and mapping it to JSON:API response

Class responsible for mapping the exception should:

* implement ExceptionMapper interface
* available trough the used discovery mechanism or added trough a module.

Sample exception mapper:

[source]
.TestExceptionMapper.java
----
include::../../../../crnk-test/src/main/java/io/crnk/test/mock/TestExceptionMapper.java[]
----

On the server-side an exception should be mapped to an `ErrorResponse` object
with `toErrorResponse`. It consists of an HTTP status and `ErrorData` (which is consistent with JSON:API error structure).
On the client-side an `ExceptionMapper` returning `true` upon `accept(...)` is used to map an
`ErrorResponse` back to an exception with `fromErrorResponse`.

Note that the exception mapper is reponsible for providing the logging of exceptions with the
appropriate log levels. Also have a look at the subsequent section about the validation module that takes
care of JSR-303 bean validation exception mapping.


## Meta Information

NOTE: With ResourceList and @JsonApiMetaInformation meta information can be returned directly. A MetaRepository implementation is no longer necessary.

There is a special interface which can be added to resource repositories to provide meta information: `io.crnk.core.repository.MetaRepository`.
It contains a single method `MetaInformation getMetaInformation(Iterable<T> resources)` which return meta information object that implements the marker `interface io.crnk.response.MetaInformation`.

If you want to add meta information along with the responses, all repositories (those that implement `ResourceRepository` and `RelationshipRepository`) must implement `MetaRepository`.

When using annotated versions of repositories, a method that returns a `MetaInformation` object should be annotated with `JsonApiMeta` and the first parameter of the method must be a list of resources.

## Links Information

NOTE: With ResourceList and @JsonApiLinksInformation links information can be returned directly. A LinksRepository implementation is usually not necessary.

There is a special interface which can be added to resource repositories to provide links information: `io.crnk.core.repository.LinksRepository`.
It contains a single method `LinksInformation getLinksInformation(Iterable<T> resources)` which return links information object that implements the marker `interface io.crnk.response.LinksInformation`.

If you want to add meta information along with the responses, all repositories (those that implement `ResourceRepository` and `RelationshipRepository`), must implement `LinksRepository`.

When using annotated versions of repositories, a method that returns a `LinksInformation` object should be annotated with `JsonApiLinks` and the first parameter of the method has to be a list of resources.


anchor:inheritance[]

## Inheritance

There are two different kinds of inheritance supported:


### Inheritance with a repository per type

Each subtype is served by its own resource repository and each repository has its own URL.

[source]
----
  @JsonApiResource(type = "task")
  public class Task {
    // fields, getters and setters
  }

  @JsonApiResource(type = "specialTask")
  public class SpecialTask extends Task{
    // fields, getters and setters
  }
----

There is no special configuration necessary. But repositories of super types must
also return resources of subtypes if they match the specified id or filter parameters.


### Inheritance with a single repository per type hierarchy

In this case all resources share a repository implementation and URL (except for the identifier part). An example may look like:

[source]
----
  @JsonApiResource(type = "task", subTypes = SpecialTask.class)
  public class Task {
    // fields, getters and setters
  }

  @JsonApiResource(type = "specialTask", resourcePath = "task")
  public class SpecialTask extends Task{
    // fields, getters and setters
  }
----

The `SpecialTask` extends `Task` but is configured to use the same `resourcePath`, meaning `SpecialTask` does not have
a repository implementation on its own, but is served by the repository of `Task`. For a more detailed example have
a look at `InheritanceWithoutSubtypeRepositoryClientTest`.


## Payload Size Optimizations

Self and related links can make up to 60% of the response payload size and not always are those links of use.
Crnk offers a `Crnk-Compact: true` header that can be sent along with the request. In this case the computation
of those links is omitted. Further relationships without data are completely omitted.



anchor:repository_decoration[]

## Repository Decoration

Sometimes it is useful to augment a repository with further features. There are  different situations where that can makes sense:

- the main repository implementation comes from a third-party library and can/should not directly be modified.
- the feature is unrelated to the main repository feature set, for example, cross-cutting concerns like security, caching, tracing and metrics.

`RepositoryDecoratorFactory` allows to do exactly that. It puts a **decorating** resource or relationship repository inbetween
the Crnk engine and the main repository. It implements the same interface contract as the main repository,
intercept all requests and can do arbitrary modifications. The modifications may or may not include calling the main repository.

An example can look like:

[source]
.ApprovalRepositoryDecorator.java
----
include::../../../../crnk-data/crnk-data-activiti/src/test/java/io/crnk/data/activiti/example/approval/ApprovalRepositoryDecorator.java[tags=docs_decorator]
----

The particular example, for example, intercepts the `save` operation and may trigger an approval workflow:

[source]
.ApprovalRepositoryDecorator.java
----
include::../../../../crnk-data/crnk-data-activiti/src/test/java/io/crnk/data/activiti/example/approval/ApprovalRepositoryDecorator.java[tags=docs_save]
----



## ResourceFieldContributor

The `ResourceFieldContributor` interface allows to dynamically introduce new fields to resources without actually
touching them. This is useful, for example, if you have a JPA entity exposed with crnk-data-jpa and
want to add further fields like that mentioned history relationship from the earlier relationship example.
`ResourceFieldContributor` can
be implemented by a repository or obtained from the regular service discovery mechanism.

Any type of field can be added: meta, links, attribute and relationship fields. For relationship fields
an application may make use of `RelationshipMatcher` to provide repository serving those fields.
Notice the `accessor` property that is used to obtain the value of that field
(make sure this method is efficient to execute). An example is given by the `HistoryRelationshipRepository` in
https://github.com/crnk-project/crnk-framework/tree/master/crnk-integration-examples/spring-boot-example[crnk-integration-examples/spring-boot-example]:

[source]
.HistoryFieldContributor
----
include::../../../../crnk-integration-examples/spring-boot-example/src/main/java/io/crnk/example/springboot/domain/repository/HistoryFieldContributor.java[tag=docs]
----

- `getRelationshipFields` introduces the field dynamically instead of statically.
- `getMatcher` attaches the repository to the historized resources.
- `findManyTarget` implements the lookup of history elements.

anchor:JsonApiExposed[]

## @JsonApiExposed

A repository may be annotated with `@JsonApiExposed(false)`. In this case the repository is only available internally to other repositories, not
externally on the JSON:API endpoint. There are different use cases for this:

- Have a look at the https://github.com/crnk-project/crnk-framework/tree/master/crnk-integration-examples/spring-boot-microservice-example[micro-service example application] to see how remote repositories can be linked to local ones.
- <<nested_resources,nested resources>> can be made accessible only through their parent, such as `http://example.com/posts/1/comments/2` and no longer `http://example.com/comments`
