# Repositories

The modelled resources must be complemented by a corresponding
repository implementation. This is achieved by implementing
one of those two repository interfaces:

  * ResourceRepositoryV2 for a resource
  * RelationshipRepositoryV2 resp. BulkRelationshipRepositoryV2 for resource relationships



## ResourceRepositoryV2

Base repository which is used to operate on resources.
Each resource should have a corresponding repository implementation.
It consist of five basic methods which provide a CRUD for a resource and two parameters: the first is a type of a resource and the second is a type of the resourceâ€™s identifier.

The methods are as follows:

* `findOne(ID id, QuerySpec querySpec)`
  Search one resource with a given ID. If a resource cannot be found, a ResourceNotFoundException exception should be thrown.
  It should return an entity with associated relationships.

* `findAll(QuerySpec querySpec)`
  Search for all of the resources. An instance of QuerySpec can be used if necessary.
  If no resources can be found an empty Iterable or null must be returned.
  It should return entities with associated relationships.

* `findAll(Iterable<ID>ids, QuerySpec querySpec)`
  Search for resources constrained by a list of identifiers. An instance of QuerySpec can be used if necessary.
  If no resources can be found an empty Iterable or null must be returned.
  It should return entities with associated relationships.

* `save(S entity)`
  Saves a resource. It should not save relating relationships. A Returning resource must include assigned identifier created for the instance of resource.
  This method should be able to both create a new resource and update existing one.

* `delete(ID id)`
  Removes a resource identified by id parameter.

The ResourceRepositoryBase is a base class that takes care of some boiler-plate, like implementing findOne with findAll. An
implementation can then look as simple as:

[source]
----
	public class ProjectRepository extends ResourceRepositoryBase<Project, String> {

		private Map<Long, Project> projects = new HashMap<>();

		public ProjectRepository() {
			super(Project.class);
			save(new Project(1L, "Project A"));
			save(new Project(2L, "Project B"));
			save(new Project(3L, "Project C"));
		}

		@Override
		public synchronized void delete(String id) {
			projects.remove(id);
		}

		@Override
		public synchronized <S extends Project> S save(S project) {
			projects.put(project.getId(), project);
			return project;
		}

		@Override
		public synchronized ResourceList<Project> findAll(QuerySpec querySpec) {
			return querySpec.apply(projects.values());
		}
	}
----

There is further a `ReadOnlyResourceRepositoryBase` base class that does not allow to override
the create, delete and update methods. `crnk-meta` accordingly reports
insertable, updateable, deltable for such repositories as false.


## RelationshipRepositoryV2

Each relationship defined in Crnk (annotation @JsonApiToOne and @JsonApiToMany) must have a relationship repository defined.

Base unidirectional repository responsible for operations on relations.
All of the methods in this interface have fieldName field as their last parameter to solve the problem of many relationships between the same resources.

* `setRelation(T source, D_ID targetId, String fieldName)`
  Sets a resource defined by targetId to a field fieldName in an instance source. If no value is to be set, null value is passed.

* `setRelations(T source, Iterable<D_ID> targetIds, String fieldName)`
  Sets resources defined by targetIds to a field fieldName in an instance source. This is a all-or-nothing operation, that is no partial relationship updates are passed. If no values are to be set, empty Iterable is passed.

* `addRelations(T source, Iterable<D_ID> targetIds, String fieldName)`
  Adds relationships to a list of relationships.

* `removeRelations(T source, Iterable<D_ID> targetIds, String fieldName)`
  Removes relationships from a list of relationships.

* `findOneTarget(T_ID sourceId, String fieldName, QuerySpec querySpec)`
  Finds one field's value defined by fieldName in a source defined by sourceId.

* `findManyTargets(T_ID sourceId, String fieldName, QuerySpec querySpec)`
  Finds an Iterable of field's values defined by fieldName in a source defined by sourceId .


This interface must be implemented to let Crnk work correctly, some of the requests are processed using only this kind of repository.
As it can be seen above, there are two kinds of methods: for multiple and single relationships and it is possible to implement only one type of methods, e.g. singular methods.
Nevertheless, it should be avoided because of potential future problems when adding new fields of other sizes.

In many cases, relationship operations can be mapped back to resource repository operations. Making the need
for a custom relationship repository implementation redundant. A findManyTargets request might can be
served by filtering the target repository. Or a relationship can be set by invoking the save operation
on either the source or target resource repository (usually you want to save on the single-valued side).
The ResourceRepositoryBase is a base class that takes care of exactly this. A repository
implementation then looks as simple as:


[source]
----
	public class ProjectToTaskRepository extends RelationshipRepositoryBase<Project, Long, Task, Long> {

		public ScheduleToTaskRepository() {
			super(Project.class, Task.class);
		}
	}
----

For this to work, relations must be set up bidirectionally with the `opposite` attribute:

[source]
----
	@JsonApiResource(type = "tasks")
	public class Task {

		@JsonApiToOne(opposite = "tasks")
		@JsonApiIncludeByDefault
		private Project project;

	    ...
	}
----


## BulkRelationshipRepositoryV2

BulkRelationshipRepositoryV2 extends RelationshipRepositoryV2 and provides an additional
`findTargets` method. It allows to fetch a relation for multiple resources at once.
It is recommended to make use of this implementation if a relationship is loaded frequently
(either by a eager declaration or trough the `include` parameter) and it is costly to
fetch that relation. RelationshipRepositoryBase provides a default implementation where
`findOneTarget` and `findManyTargets` forward calls to the bulk `findTargets`.




## ResourceList

ResourceRepositoryV2 and RelationshipRepositoryV2 return lists of type ResourceList. The ResourceList can carry, next
to the actual resources, also meta and links information:

* `getLinks()`
	Gets the links information attached to this lists.

* `getMeta()`
	Gets the meta information attached to this lists.

* `getLinks(Class<L> linksClass)`
	Gets the links information of the given type attached to this lists. If the given type is not found, null is returned.

* `getMeta(Class<M> metaClass)`
	Gets the meta information of the given type attached to this lists. If the given type is not found, null is returned.

There is a default implementation named DefaultResourceList. To gain type-safety, improved readability and crnk-client support,
application may provide a custom implementation extending ResourceListBase:

[source]
----
	class ScheduleList extends ResourceListBase<Schedule, ScheduleListMeta, ScheduleListLinks> {

	}

	class ScheduleListLinks implements LinksInformation {

		public String name = "value";

		...
	}

	class ScheduleListMeta implements MetaInformation {

		public String name = "value";

		...
	}
----

This implementation can then be added to a repository interface declaration
and used by both servers and clients:

[source]
----
	public interface ScheduleRepository extends ResourceRepositoryV2<Schedule, Long> {

		@Override
		public ScheduleList findAll(QuerySpec querySpec);

	}
----




## Query parameters with QuerySpec

Crnk passes JSON API query parameters to repositories trough a QuerySpec parameter. It holds
request parameters like sorting and filtering specified by JSON API. The subsequent
sections will provide a number of example.

NOTE: Not everything is specified by JSON API. For some request parameters only recommendations
are provided as different applications are likely to be in need of different semantics and
implementations. For this reason the engine part in `crnk-core` makes use of `QueryAdapter` and allows implementations other than
QuerySpec (like the legacy `QueryParams`).


### Filtering

NOTE: The JSON API specification does not a mandate a specific filtering semantic. Instead
it provides a recommendation that comes by default with Crnk. Depending on the data store
in use, application may choose to extend or replace that default implementation.

Resource filtering can be achieved by providing parameters which start with `filter`.
The format for filters: `filter[ResourceType][property|operator]([property|operator])* = "value"`

* `GET /tasks/?filter[name]=Super task`
* `GET /tasks/?filter[name][EQ]=Super task`
* `GET /tasks/?filter[tasks][name]=Super task`
* `GET /tasks/?filter[tasks][name]=Super task&filter[tasks][dueDate]=2015-10-01`

QuerySpec uses the `EQ` operator if no operator was provided.

Operators are represented by the `FilterOperator` class. Crnk comes with a set of
default filters:

[cols="1,3", options="header"]
|===
|Name
|Descriptor

|`EQ`
|equals operator where values match exactly.

|`NEQ`
|not equals where values do not match.

|`LIKE`
|where the value matches the specified pattern. It is usually
 not case-sensitive and makes use of `%` as wildclard, but
 may different depending on the underlying implementation.

|`LT`
|lower than the specified value

|`LE`
|lower than or equals the specified value

|`GT`
|greater than the specified value

|`GE`
|greater than or equals the specified value
|===

The application is free to implements its own `FilterOperator`. Next to the name
a `matches` method can be implemented to support in-memory filtering
with `QuerySpec.apply`. Otherwise, it is up to the repository implementation
to handle the various filter operators; usually by translating them
to datastore-native query expressions. Custom operators can be registered
with `DefaultQuerySpecDeserializer.addSupportedOperator(..)`. The default operator can be
overridden by setting `DefaultQuerySpecDeserializer.setDefaultOperator(...)`.


### Sorting

Sorting information for the resources can be achieved by providing `sort` parameter.

* `GET /tasks/?sort=name,-shortName`
* `GET /tasks/?sort[projects]=name,-shortName&include=projects`


anchor:pagination[]

### Pagination

Pagination for the repositories can be achieved by providing `page` parameter.
The format for pagination: `page[offset|limit] = "value", where value is an integer`

Example:

* `GET /tasks/?page[offset]=0&page[limit]=10`


The JSON API specifies `first`, `previous`, `next` and `last` links (see http://jsonapi.org/format/#fetching-pagination).
The `PagedLinksInformation` interface provides a Java representation of those links that can be implemented and returned
by repositories along with the result data. There is a default implementation named `DefaultPagedLinksInformation`.

There are two ways to let Crnk compute pagination links automatically:

1. The repository returns meta information implementing `PagedMetaInformation`. With this interface the total
   number of (potentially filtered) resources is passed to Crnk, which in turn allows the computation of the links.
2. The repository returns meta information implementing `HasMoreResourcesMetaInformation`. This interface
   only specifies whether further resources are available after the currently requested resources. This
   lets Crnk compute all except the `last` link.

Note that for both approaches the repository has to return either no links or links information implementing
`PagedLinksInformation`. If the links are already set, then the computation will be skipped.

The potential benefit of the second over the first approach is that it might be easier to just
determine whether more resources are available rather than counting all resources.
This is typically achieved by querying `limit + 1` resources.


### Sparse Fieldsets

Information about fields to include in the response can be achieved by providing `fields` parameter.

* `GET /tasks/?fields=name`
* `GET /tasks/?fields[projects]=name,description&include=projects`



### Inclusion of Related Resources

Information about relationships to include in the response can be achieved by providing `include` parameter.
The format for fields: `include[ResourceType] = "property(.property)*"`

Examples:

* `GET /tasks/?include[tasks]=project`
* `GET /tasks/1/?include[tasks]=project`
* `GET /tasks/?include[tasks]=author`
* `GET /tasks/?include[tasks][]=author&include[tasks][]=comments`
* `GET /tasks/?include[projects]=task&include[tasks]=comments`
* `GET /tasks/?include[projects]=task&include=comments` (QuerySpec example)


### API

The QuerySpec API looks like (further setters available as well):

[source]
----
	public class QuerySpec {
		public <T> List<T> apply(Iterable<T> resources){...}

		public Long getLimit() {...}

		public long getOffset() {...}

		public List<FilterSpec> getFilters() {...}

		public List<SortSpec> getSort() {...}

		public List<IncludeFieldSpec> getIncludedFields() {...}

		public List<IncludeRelationSpec> getIncludedRelations() {...}

		public QuerySpec getQuerySpec(Class<?> resourceClass) {...}

		...
	}
----

Note that single QuerySpec holds the parameters for a single resource type and,
in more complex scenarios, request can lead to multiple QuerySpec instances
(namely when related resources are also filtered, sorted, etc). A repository
is invoked with the QuerySpec for the requested root type. If related resources are
included in the request, their QuerySpecs can be obtained by calling `QuerySpec.getRelatedSpec(Class)` on the root QuerySpec.

`FilterSpec` holds a value of type object. Since URL parameters are passed as String,
they get converted to the proper types by the `DefaultQuerySpecDeserializer`. The
type is determined based on the type of the filtered attribute.

QuerySpec provides a method `apply` that allows in-memory sorting, filtering and paging
on any `java.util.Collection`. It is useful for testing and on smaller datasets to keep
the implementation of a repository as simple as possible. It returns a ResourceList
that carries a PagedMetaInformation that lets Crnk automatically compute pagination links.



### DefaultQuerySpecDeserializer

Crnk make use of `DefaultQuerySpecDeserializer` to map URL parameters to a QuerySpec instance.
This instance is accessible from the various integrations, such as from the `CrnkFeature`. It
provides a number of customization options:

* `setDefaultLimit(Long)`
	Sets the page limit if none is specified by the request.

* `setMaxPageLimit(Long)`
	Sets the maximum page limit allowed to be requested.

* `setAllowUnknownAttributes(boolean)`
	`DefaultQuerySpecDeserializer` validates all passed parameters against the domain model and fails
	if one of the attributes is unknown. This flag allows to disable that check in case the should be necessary.

* `setIgnoreParseExceptions(boolean)`
	`DefaultQuerySpecDeserializer` attempts to convert all filter parameters to their proper type based on the
	attribute type to be filtered. In some scenarios like dates this behavior may be undesirable as applications
	introduce expressions like 'now`. Enabling this flag will let `DefaultQuerySpecDeserializer` ignore
	such values and provide them as `String` within `FilterSpec`.

* `setEnforceDotPathSeparator(boolean)`
	DefaultQuerySpecDeserializer by default supports by default two URL conventions:
	 `http://.../resource?filter[task][project][name]=myProject` and
	 `http://.../resource?filter[task][project.name]=myProject`. The later is recommended. The former
	 still supported for historic reasons. By default the flag is still disabled, but it is recommended
	 to be packagingEnabled and will become the default at some point in the future. Note that without the enforcement,
	 there is danger of introducing ambiguity with resources and attributes are named equally.


Note that appropriate page limits are vital to protect against denial-of-service attacks when working
with large data sets! Such attacks may not be of malicious nature, but normals users using a browser
and omitting to specify pagination parameters.

`DefaultQuerySpecDeserializer` implements `QuerySpecDeserializer` and you may also provide your own
implementation to further customize its behavior. The various integrations like `CrnkFeature` will
allow to replace the implementation.

One can get access to `DefaultQuerySpecDeserializer` trough the various integrations, e.g.
`CrnkFeature.getQuerySpecDeserializer()`. For more information have a look at the
<<setup,setup chapter>>.



## Error Handling

Processing errors in Crnk can be handled by throwing an exception and providing
a corresponding exception mapper which defines mapping to a proper JSON API error response.


### Throwing an exception...

Here is an example of throwing an Exception in the code:

[source]
----
  if (somethingWentWrong()) {
    throw new SampleException("errorId", "Oops! Something went wrong.")
  }
----

Sample exception is nothing more than a simple runtime exception:

[source]
----
  public class SampleException extends RuntimeException {

    private final String id;
    private final String title;

    public ExampleException(String id, String title) {
      this.id = id;
      this.title = title;
    }

    public String getId() {
      return id;
    }

    public String getTitle() {
      return title;
    }
  }
----

### ...and mapping it to JSON API response

Class responsible for mapping the exception should:

* implement ExceptionMapper interface
* available trough the used discovery mechanism or added trough a module.

Sample exception mapper:

[source]
.TestExceptionMapper.java
----
include::../../../../crnk-test/src/main/java/io/crnk/test/mock/TestExceptionMapper.java[]
----

On the server-side an exception should be mapped to an `ErrorResponse` object
with `toErrorResponse`. It consists of an HTTP status and `ErrorData` (which is consistent with JSON API error structure).
On the client-side an `ExceptionMapper` returning `true` upon `accept(...)` is used to map an
`ErrorResponse` back to an exception with `fromErrorResponse`.

Note that the exception mapper is reponsible for providing the logging of exceptions with the
appropriate log levels. Also have a look at the subsequent section about the validation module that takes
care of JSR-303 bean validation exception mapping.


## Meta Information

NOTE: With ResourceList and @JsonApiMetaInformation meta information can be returned directly. A MetaRepository implementation is no longer necessary.

There is a special interface which can be added to resource repositories to provide meta information: `io.crnk.core.repository.MetaRepository`.
It contains a single method `MetaInformation getMetaInformation(Iterable<T> resources)` which return meta information object that implements the marker `interface io.crnk.response.MetaInformation`.

If you want to add meta information along with the responses, all repositories (those that implement `ResourceRepository` and `RelationshipRepository`) must implement `MetaRepository`.

When using annotated versions of repositories, a method that returns a `MetaInformation` object should be annotated with `JsonApiMeta` and the first parameter of the method must be a list of resources.

## Links Information

NOTE: With ResourceList and @JsonApiLinksInformation links information can be returned directly. A LinksRepository implementation is usually not necessary.

There is a special interface which can be added to resource repositories to provide links information: `io.crnk.core.repository.LinksRepository`.
It contains a single method `LinksInformation getLinksInformation(Iterable<T> resources)` which return links information object that implements the marker `interface io.crnk.response.LinksInformation`.

If you want to add meta information along with the responses, all repositories (those that implement `ResourceRepository` and `RelationshipRepository`), must implement `LinksRepository`.

When using annotated versions of repositories, a method that returns a `LinksInformation` object should be annotated with `JsonApiLinks` and the first parameter of the method has to be a list of resources.
