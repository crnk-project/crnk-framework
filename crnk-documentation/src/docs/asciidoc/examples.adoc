# Examples

Crnk comes with various examples. There is a main example application in a dedicated repository
available from https://github.com/crnk-project/crnk-example[crnk-example]. It *shows an end-to-end example*
with Crnk, Angular, Spring Boot and ngrx-json-api.

And there are various simpler example applications that show the integration of Crnk into various frameworks like:

- `spring-boot-example`
- `wildfly-example`
- `dropwizard-mongo-example`
- `dropwizard-simple-example`
- `jersey-example`

available from https://github.com/crnk-project/crnk-framework/tree/master/crnk-examples/[crnk-examples].

The impatient may also directly want to jump to <<resource_repository,ResourceRepositoryV2>>, but it is highly recommended to
familiarize one self with the architecture and annotations as well. Unlike traditional REST libraries, Crnk comes with a lot of
built-in semantics that allow to automate otherwise laborious tasks.
