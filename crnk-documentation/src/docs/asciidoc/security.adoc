# Security

The resource-oriented nature of Crnk makes a number of quite powerful security schemes possible
to authorize access to resources. The semantics of JSON:API with resources, relationships, fields
and parameters provide much more information about an application compared to, for example, a
more classical JAX-RS oder Spring MVC application. This in turn allows to automate and simplify
many security-related topics, which in turn allows for a more robust authorization.

Authorization can happen on three levels:

- Resource-based authorization: only a subset of all resource types are accessible to the user.
- Field-based authorization: only a subset of the fields (attributes and relationships) of a resource are accessible to the user.
- Data-based authorization: only a subset of all resources of a given type are accessible to the user
      based on the contents of the resources. Typically denominated Dataroom access control (DAC).

Crnk comes with support for all three. The subsequent sections outline a number of different strategies how to apply them.

## Authentication

Authorization requires to first know the calling user through authentication. Crnk is agnostic to
the used authorization scheme and is usually provided by the underlying integration, for example,
the `Principal` of JEE or the `SecurityContext` of Spring Security. They in turn are populated
from a scheme like OAuth, JWT or SAML.

Crnk makes use of `SecurityProvider` to integrate with such systems and check access to roles
for the current user:

[source]
.SecurityProvider.java
----
include::../../../../crnk-core/src/main/java/io/crnk/core/engine/security/SecurityProvider.java[]
----

The JAX-RS and servlet integration of Crnk come both with a `SecurityProvider` implementation. Which in
turn also provides an implementation for all integrations derived from them, such as Spring.

The `SecurityProvider` is accessible from the module API and can be used to perform both DAC and RBAC
or any other kind of check.



## Resource-based Access Control with the SecurityModule

There is a `SecurityModule` provided by `crnk-security` that intercepts all repository requests and
perform access control. Currently it supports resource-based access control.
A setup can looks as follows:

[source]
.SecurityModuleIntTest.java
----
include::../../../../crnk-security/src/test/java/io/crnk/security/SecurityModuleIntTest.java[tags=setup]
----

A builder is used to construct rules. Each rule grants access to either a given or all resources.
Thereby `ResourcePermission` specifies the set of authorized methods: `GET`, `POST`, `PATCH`, `DELETE`.

Once the rules are defined, the runtime checks go well beyond more traditional approaches like
JEE `@RolesAllowed` annotation. The rules are enforced in various contexts:

- Access to resource repositories are checked.
- Access to relationship repositories are checked based on the target (return) type.
- Relationship fields targeting resources the user is not authorized to see are omitted from results and cannot
  be modified.
- A request may span multiple repository accesses in case of inclusions with the `include` parameter. In this
  case every access is checked individually.
- `HomeModule` and `MetaModule` show only resources the user is authorized to see. In case of the `MetaModule`
  the `MetaAttribute` and `MetaResource` provide further information about what can be read, inserted, updated and
  deleted.
- (soon) Query parameters for sorting and filtering are checked against unauthorized access to
  related resources.

Internally the security module makes use of `ResourceFilter` to perform this task. More information about that is
available in a subsequent section.

Is is up to the application how and when to configure the `SecurityModule`. The set of rules can be static
or created dynamically. `SecurityModule.reconfigure(...)` allows to replace the security
rules at runtime.

## Role-based Access Control with ResourceFilter

The `SecurityModule` is only one example how to implement security. Underlying it is the `ResourceFilter` interface
provided by the Crnk engine:

[source]
.ResourceFilter.java
----
include::../../../../crnk-core/src/main/java/io/crnk/core/engine/filter/ResourceFilter.java[tags=docs]
----

`ResourceFilter` allows to restrict access to resources and fields. To methods `filterResource` and
`filterField` can be implemented for this purpose. Both return a `FilterBehavior` which allows to
distinguish between `NONE`, `IGNORE` and `FORBIDDEN`. For example, a field like a
lock count can make use of `IGNORE` in order to be ignored for POST and PATCH requests (the current value
on the server is left untouched). While access to an unauthorized resource or
field results in a forbidden error with `FORBIDDEN`. An example is given by the
`SecurityResourceFilter` of `SecurityModule` in 'crnk-security`. Since `ResourceFilter` methods are
invoked often, it is important for them to return quickly.

There is a `ResourceFilterDirectory` that complements `ResourceFilter`. It allows to query the authorization status
of a particular resource or field in context of the current request. The `ResourceFilterDirectory` makes
use of per-request caching as the information may be accessed repeatedly for a request.
It can be obtained with `ModuleContext.getResourceFilterDirectory(...)` from the module API. For example, the `MetaModule` and
`HomeModule` make use of `ResourceFilterDirectory` to only list authorized elements.

Out of scope for `ResourceFilter` is the filtering based on data, this subject of the DataRoom Access Control
of the next section.


## Dataroom Access Control

Filtering of resources is one of the main building blocks of JSON:API. As such it is typically
not too hard to implement DAC. The roles of a user can be checked and if necessary
for filters specific to that user can be added. There are two possibilities
to add such filters:

- by updating the repository filters.
- by implementing a repository decorator that intercepts the request before reaching the repository.
  For more information see <<repository_decoration,Repository Decoration>>.

The `SecurityModule` comes with built-in support for DAC. An example looks like:

[source]
.DataRoomFilterTest.java
----
include::../../../../crnk-security/src/test/java/io/crnk/security/DataRoomFilterTest.java[tags=docs]
----

A `DataRoomFilter` can be passed to the `SecurityConfig`. It has to provide
a `QuerySpec` of what the current caller is allowed to see. In the
example here all callers are just allowed to see tasks named
`foo`. Real-world scenarios access the user principal and roles to decide for
a particular filter. The returned `QuerySpec` is applied to all repository operations: `GET`, `PATCH`, `POST` and
`DELETE`:


[cols="1,3", options="header"]
|===
|Method
|Descripton

|`GET`
| Added to the caller `QuerySpec` to filter by both caller and DataRoom filters. This will
  remove any sensitive/undesired resources from the result. Note that it is important to
  adapt the `QuerySpec` rather than filtering results of the query: only the former
  efficiently supports paging (if necessary, one can workaround this a bit for the later
  if deemed in practical by always query with offset 0 and limiting the number of pages one can request).
  Note there is also a further subtle difference when requesting a single resource by id:
  A `FORBIDDEN` status code is returned and a warning written to the log if the resource
  with the requested ID does not pass DAC. It is assumed that the caller should not know
  its ID in the first place.

|`POST`
| Verifies that the created resources matches with DataRoom filter. Checks are
  performed in memory with `QuerySpec.apply`.

|`PATCH`
| Equivalent to `POST` but further verifiers that the caller has access to the existing,
  unchanged resource. Implementors may further those to make involved fields
  immutable with `@JsonApiField(patchable=false)`.

|`DELETE`
| Verifies that deleted resources match DataRoom filtering by querying them before deletion.
|===

IMPORTANT: When accessing relationship repositories, only one side is checked
  for performance reasons. It is assumed that `DataRoomFilter` applies proper filters to
  both sides of a relationship. For `GET` it is the target side of the relationship
  (the returned resources), for `PATCH`, `POST` and `DELETE` the modified source side.



## Adapt User Interfaces based on Authorizations

In many cases it is desired to adjust UIs based on the authorizations of a user to guide the
user early what he is authorized to do. There are two mechanisms that are outlined
in the next sections.

### ResourcePermissionInformation

The `ResourcePermissionInformation` interface specializes `MetaInformation` to
give access to the `ResourcePermission` of that particular element, either a list
or a single resource. If either of the two carries a `MetaInformation` implementing `ResourcePermissionInformation`, then the `SecurityModule`
will fill-in the `ResourcePermission` for the current request.


### API

`SecurityModule.setExposeRepositories(true)` sets up repositories accessible through the
`<contextPath>/security/` path. Currently supported are:

- `<contextPath>/security/role` to gain access to all configure roles.
- `<contextPath>/security/callerPermission` to gain access to all permissions of the current caller.


### Home and Meta Module

- `HomeModule` and `MetaModule` hide resources the user is not authorized to see.
  Any UI can query their respective URLs to gain information about what the user is authorized to see.
- The `MetaAttribute`  and `MetaResource` resources from the `MetaModule`  further show
  information about which resources and fields can be inserted, updated and deleted.
  The resources are available from `/meta/attributes` and `/meta/resource` respectively.


## Provide Authentication Information to the User

A frequent use case is to display user/login related information for a user. However, Crnk does not
do authentication on its own and the set of provided information is typically application-specific.
As such there is no direct support from Crnk, but a custom repository can look like:


[source]
.LoginRepository.java
----
 public class LoginRepository extends ResourceRepositoryBase<Login, String> {


 	public LoginRepository() {
 		super(Login.class);
 	}

 	@Override
 	public ResourceList<Login> findAll(QuerySpec querySpec) {
 		List<Login> logins = new ArrayList<>();
 		SecurityContext context = SecurityContextHolder.getContext();
 		if (context != null) {
 			Authentication authentication = context.getAuthentication();
 			Login me = new Login();
 			me.setId("me");
 			me.setUserName(authentication.getName());
 			logins.add(me);
 		}
 		return querySpec.apply(logins);
 	}
}
----

This particular example has been taken from
https://github.com/crnk-project/crnk-example/blob/master/crnk-example-service/src/main/java/io/crnk/example/service/security/LoginRepository.java[crnk-example].



## Exception Mapping

Crnk comes with four exceptions that are relevant in a security context:

- `io.crnk.core.exception.ForbiddenException` results in a HTTP `403` status code and forbids access to the requested element.
- `io.crnk.core.exception.UnauthorizedException` results in a HTTP `401` status code to trigger authentication.
- `io.crnk.core.exception.RepositoryNotFoundException` and `io.crnk.core.exception.ResourceNotFoundException` may be
  used in favor of `io.crnk.core.exception.ForbiddenException` to completely hide unauthorized resources with a status `404`
  indistinguishable from non-existing ones.


## (Potential) Future Work

- Authorize access to fields with `SecurityModule`.
- Authorize sort and filter parameters.
- Resource annotations to configure `SecurityModule`.
- Deny rules for `SecurityModule`.
- Potentially give security-related information through `OPTIONS` requests.
- DAC support for `SecurityModule`.
