# Architecture

*Resources*, *relationships* and *repositories* are the central building blocks of Crnk:

- Resources hold data as value fields, meta information and link information.
- Relationships establish links between resources.
- *resource repositories* and *relationship repositories* implement access to resources and relationships.

A Crnk application models its API as resources and relationships. It is not uncommon for applications to also have a few remaining
service-oriented APIs. Later chapters will show how Crnk integrates with other libraries like JAX-RS or Spring MVC to achieve this.
Based on such a model, an application implements repositories to provide access trough that model.

Currently implemented is the JSON:API specification to access that model as part of the `crnk-core` project. The JSON:API specification provide
all the essential building blocks like sorting, filtering, paging, document formats, linking and error handling to access
resources and relationships. But other implementations, such as GraphQL or different kinds of REST/JSON:APIs, are possible as
well. With JSON:API, an incoming request is processed as follows:

- A Crnk interceptor is called from the underlying framework. This might be, for example, from a Servlet environment,
 JAX-RS or Spring MVC.
- The request is deserialized to Crnk data structures like `Document`, `Resource`, `ResourceIdentifier` or `ErrorData`.
- The type of request is determined: whether it is a `POST`, `PATCH`, `GET` or `DELETE` request and whether it is a resource or
relationship request.
- The request is forwarded to the appropriate repository.
- `GET` requests can ask for inclusions of further, related resources. Result resources will then trigger further requests to
  other repositories. This can happen either manually from within the initially called repository or automatically
  by Crnk (explained in detail in later chapters).
- The result resources are merged into response document and returned to the underlying framework for delivery. Possible
  exceptions are handled as and mapped as well.


A benefit of Crnk is its flexibility how to set all this up:

- Resources and relationships can be defined with simple Java Beans and annotations or programmatically. The later allows
  virtually any kind of customization at runtime, like setting up repositories dynamically. One example is `crnk-data-jpa`
  that is able to expose any JPA entity as JSON:API resource.
- Resources and relationships can be entirely decoupled concerns. For example, an independent relationship repository `C` can
  introduce a relationship between a resource `a` and resource `b` implemented by resource repositories `A` and `B`.
  For example, an audit component could intercept and log any modifications. Access to it is provided by introducing a
  new relationship `history` onto each resource.
- Information about resources, relationships and repositories are available trough a Java API and JSON:API endpoint.
- Filters and decorators allow to intercept and modify every step along the request chain. This can be used, for example,
  to enforce security, collect metrics or do tracing.

To facilitate the setup, Crnk comes with a small module API. Independent functionality can be assembled as module and then just
included into the application. Crnk comes with a number of modules on its own:

- `crnk-data-jpa`
- `crnk-validation`
- `crnk-operations`
- various Spring modules
- ...

Such modules can make use of filters, decorators, decoupled resources and relationships and various other features.
Everything together fosters the use of the *composite pattern* where larger applications can be assembled from smaller
parts, some from third-party modules and others manually implemented.

The part of `crnk-core` taking care of all this is denoted as the `engine`. The subsequent chapters explain how to setup and use Crnk.
