# Architecture

*Resources* and *repositories* are the main object types in use by Crnk. Those types closely reflect the
JSON API specification. Resources hold the data; while repositories implement the access to those resources. A
running Crnk application can have any number of those repositories which may or may not be related. To establish
such relations, there is further a distinction between *resource repositories* and *relationship repositories*.

The `crnk-core` project hosts a `engine` package that provides an implementation of the JSON API specification.
It processes incoming requests and makes the appropriate calls to repositories. A single request may make one or multiple calls
 to repositories. Multiple
repository are called when the request asks for inclusions of related resoures where the main repository chooses
to not directly handle those inclusions by itself (explained in detail in later chapters). In the background
the engine takes care of details like serialization, repository lookup and error handling. For this
to work it offers a module API to customize and extend the Crnk feature set. The engine
does not dictate how resources and repositories are implemented. It makes use of a more abstract
information model and adapters to forward call to a particular implementation. This allows for a lot of flexibility
in the repository design. In many cases users will make use of annotations and interfaces provided by `crnk-core`
which follow the specification and recommendations of JSON API. But there is also the possibility to implement
repositories in other fashions like it has been done in `crnk-jpa`.

The subsequent chapters explain how to setup and use Crnk.
