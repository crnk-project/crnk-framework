# Architecture

*Resources*, *relationships* and *repositories* are the central building blocks of Crnk:

- Resources hold data as value attributes, meta information and link information.
- Relationships establish links between resources.
- *resource repositories* and *relationship repositories* implement access to resources and relationships.
  `GET`, `POST`, `PATCH`, `DELETE` requests allow to interact with the repositories.

A Crnk application models its API as resources and relationships. One may also call it a *graph* with one
wants to throw in some current buzzword. For example, for a `person` resource holding an address, there
are different possibilities to set it up in such a resource-oriented
way:

- A `person` resource holding address information as attribute. A `PATCH` request to `/api/person/{id}`
  with the new address will update the attribute on the person accordingly.
- A `person` resource, an `address` resource and a relationship between the two. Then a `PATCH`
  request to `/api/person/{id}/relationships/address` will trigger an update of the relationship.
- A dedicated `AddressChangeResource` that is in a relationship with the `person` resource.
  Then a `POST` request to `/api/addressChange` or `/api/person/{id}/addressChange` (depending on the setup)
  will trigger a new address change. This is
  the most elaborate setup and can complement the `address` relationship from before. It allows not just
  to trigger a change, but also, for example, to query
  the current status and get a history of changes. This in turn allows to model more complex workflows where
  an address change may take a larger mount of time and may involve further manual steps.

The opposite to this are RPC-style APIs, where one would implement a `changeAddress` service taking
the person id and new address as input and performing the desired changes. Crnk
focuses on resource-oriented APIs, but still works well together with the later, for which there are already many
libraries out there such as JAX-RS and Spring MVC.

The *benefits of resource-oriented APIs* are:

- A clean, consistent model of your API. Seeing it means understanding it. The semantics of resource and relationships
  are well established. Consumers can learn about the API by just browsing it through the provided linking.
- Better evolution into the future. RPC-style APIs frequently suffer from many different, isolated services. Every
  service can basically do whatever it pleases. Over time this can lead to difficulties understanding and changing a system.
- Better testability and mocking: By using built-in in-memory repositories and providing test data for resources, a fully
  running endpoint can be achieved within hours. After that can, for example, frontend and backend development
  take place in parallel without uncertainty about API contracts.
- The basic yet powerful model allows for a rich set of tooling and automation to reduce the amount of custom coding.
  Crnk comes with support for JPA, JSR-303 validation, faceted search support, OpenTracing and more next to
  handling lower-layer REST details, linking and relationships.

Crnk is implemented as library rather than new framework. It almost no third-party dependencies, is
lightweight in design and integrates well with many other libraries like Vert.X, JAX-RS and Spring Boot.

Crnk follows, but is not limited by the https://jsonapi.org/[JSON:API] specification to built resource-oriented APIs.
Its implementation is hosted in the `crnk-core` project. The JSON:API specification provides
all the essential building blocks like sorting, filtering, paging, document formats, linking and error handling to access
resources and relationships. If desired, also other protocols like GraphQL and custom REST API contract can be
implemented by updating the serialization layer of `crnk-core`. To understand the inner working, it is
important to know how requests are processed:

- A Crnk interceptor is called from the underlying framework. This might be, for example, from a Servlet environment,
 JAX-RS or Spring MVC.
- The request is deserialized to Crnk data structures like `Document`, `Resource`, `ResourceIdentifier` or `ErrorData`.
- The type of request is determined: whether it is a `POST`, `PATCH`, `GET` or `DELETE` request and whether it is a resource or
relationship request.
- The request is forwarded to the appropriate repository implementation.
- `GET` requests can ask for inclusions of further, related resources. Result resources will then trigger further requests to
  other repositories. This can happen either manually from within the initially called repository or automatically
  by Crnk (explained in detail in later chapters).
- The result resources are merged into response document and returned to the underlying framework for delivery. Possible
  exceptions are handled as and mapped as well.


A benefit of Crnk is its flexibility how to set all this up:

- Resources and relationships can be defined with simple Java Beans and annotations or programmatically. The later allows
  virtually any kind of customization at runtime. One example is `crnk-data-jpa`
  that is able to expose any JPA entity as resource.
- Resources and relationships can be entirely decoupled concerns. A new relationship repository can introduce
  an additoinal relationship to existing resources. For example, an audit component could intercept and log any
  modifications and introduce a new relationship `history` onto each resource to access it.
- Information about resources, relationships and repositories are available trough a Java API and resource endpoint.
- Filters and decorators allow to intercept and modify every step along the request chain. This can be used, for example,
  to enforce security, collect metrics or do tracing.

To facilitate the setup, Crnk comes with a small module API. Independent functionality can be assembled as module and then just
included into the application. Crnk comes with a number of modules on its own:

- `crnk-data-jpa`
- `crnk-data-facets`
- `crnk-validation`
- `crnk-operations`
- Spring modules
- ...

Such modules can make use of filters, decorators, decoupled resources and relationships and various other features.
Everything together fosters the use of the *composite pattern* where larger applications can be assembled from smaller
parts, some from third-party modules and others from manually implemented ones.
