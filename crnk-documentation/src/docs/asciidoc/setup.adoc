# Setup

Crnk integrates well with many popular framework. The example applications outline various different possible
setups. But application are also free to customize their setup to their liking.
There are three main, orthogonal aspects of Crnk that need configuration:

1. The integration into a web framework like JAXRS or the Servlet API to be able to process requests.
2. The discovery of repositories, modules, exception mappers, etc. Usually by a dependency injection framework. But can also
   happen manually.
3. The selection of third-party modules to reuse. For a list of modules provided by Crnk see the <modules> chapter.

The subsequent sections explain various possibilities resp. how to implement a custom one.
The <<reactive>> chapter further outlines how to setup Crnk in an asynchronous/reactive setting.



## Requirements

Crnk library requires minimum Java 8 (as of Crnk 2.4) to build and run. In the future it will come with support
for both the current major Java releases (9, 10, 11, etc.) and the current long-term support version that gets
released every three years.

## BOM

With `io.crnk:crnk-bom` a Maven BOM is provided that manages the dependencies of all crnk artifacts.
In Gradle the setup then looks as follows:

[source]
----
buildscript {
	dependencies {
		classpath "io.spring.gradle:dependency-management-plugin:1.0.4.RELEASE"
	}
}

gradle.beforeProject { Project project ->
	project.with {
		apply plugin: 'io.spring.dependency-management'
		dependencyManagement {
			imports {
				mavenBom "io.crnk:crnk-bom:$CRNK_VERSION"
			}
		}
	}
}
----

The crnk modules can then simply be used without having to specify a version:

[source]
----
dependencies {
	compile 'io.crnk:crnk-rs'
	compile 'io.crnk:crnk-setup-spring-boot2'
	...
}
----

## Logging

Crnk makes use of SLF4J to do logging. Make sure to have the API properly setup. For example by making use of Logback or one of the many bridges to
other Logging frameworks.

TIP: Set `io.crnk` to `DEBUG` if you encounter any issues during setup or later at runtime.


## Integration with JAX-RS

Crnk allows integration with JAX-RS environments through the usage of JAX-RS specification. JAX-RS 2.0 is
required for this integration. Under the hood there is a @PreMatching filter which checks each request for
JSON API processing. The setup can look as simple as:

### CrnkFeature

[source]
----
@ApplicationPath("/")
	public class MyApplication extends Application {

		@Override
		public Set<Object> getSingletons() {
			CrnkFeature crnkFeature = new CrnkFeature();
			return Collections.singleton((Object)crnkFeature);
		}
	}
----

`CrnkFeature` provides various accessors to customize the behavior of Crnk.
A more advanced setup may look like:

[source]
----
	public class MyAdvancedCrnkFeature implements Feature {

		@Inject
		private EntityManager em;

		@Inject
		private EntityManagerFactory emFactory;

		...

		@Override
		public boolean configure(FeatureContext featureContext) {
			// also map entities to JSON API resources (see further below)
			JpaModule jpaModule = new JpaModule(emFactory, em, transactionRunner);
			jpaModule.setRepositoryFactory(new ValidatedJpaRepositoryFactory());

			// limit all incoming requests to 20 resources if not specified otherwise
			DefaultQuerySpecUrlMapper urlMapper = new DefaultQuerySpecUrlMapper();
			urlMapper.setDefaultLimit(20L);

			ServiceLocator serviceLocator = ...
			CrnkFeature feature = new CrnkFeature();
			feature.addModule(jpaModule);
			feature.getBoot().setUrlMapper(urlMapper);

			featureContext.register(feature);
			return true;
		}
	}
----

Crnk will install a JAX-RS filter that will intercept and process any Crnk-related request.

Note that depending on the discovery mechanism in use (like Spring or CDI), modules like this JpaModule can be picked
up automatically and do not manual registration.

### Exception mapping for JAX-RS services

In many cases Crnk repositories are used along regular JAX-RS services. In such scenarios it can be worthwhile
if Crnk repositories and JAX-RS services make use of the same exception handling and response format. To make
use of the JSON API resp. Crnk exception handling in JAX-RS services, one can add the
*JsonapiExceptionMapperBridge* to the JAX-RS application. The constructor of `JsonapiExceptionMapperBridge`
takes `CrnkFeature` as parameter.

For an example have a look at the next section which make use of it together with `JsonApiResponseFilter`.


### Use JSON API format with JAX-RS services

Similar to `JsonapiExceptionMapperBridge` in the previous section, it is possible for JAX-RS services to return
resources in JSON API format with *JsonApiResponseFilter*. `JsonApiResponseFilter` wraps primitive
responses with a `data` object; resource objects with `data` and `included` objects.
The constructor of `JsonApiResponseFilter` takes `CrnkFeature` as parameter.


To determine which JAX-RS services should be wrapped, `JsonApiResponseFilter` checks whether the
`@Produce` annotation delivers JSON API. The produce
annotation can be added, for example, to the class:

[source]
.ScheduleRepository.java
----
include::../../../../crnk-test/src/main/java/io/crnk/test/mock/repository/ScheduleRepository.java[tags=annotation]
----

And the JAX-RS application setup looks like:

[source]
.JsonApiResponseFilterTestBase.java
----
include::../../../../crnk-setup/crnk-setup-rs/src/test/java/io/crnk/rs/JsonApiResponseFilterTestBase.java[tags=docs]
----

Note that:

- `CrnkProperties.NULL_DATA_RESPONSE_ENABLED` determines whether null responses should be wrapped
   as JSON API responses.
- Make use of proper service discovery instead of `CrnkProperties.RESOURCE_SEARCH_PACKAGE` in real applications.


### JAX-RS service interoperability

It is possible to implement repositories that host both JAX-RS and JSON-API methods to complement JSON
API repositories with non-resource based services. Have a look at the <<client_jaxrs,Crnk Client chapter>> for an example.


## Integration with Servlet API

There are two ways of integrating crnk using Servlets:

* Adding an instance of ``CrnkServlet``
* Adding an instance of ``CrnkFilter``

### Integrating using a Servlet

There is a `CrnkServlet` implementation allowing to integrate Crnk into a Servlet environment.
It can be configured with all the parameters outlined in the subsequent sections. Many times
application will desire to do more advanced customizations, in this case one can
extends `CrnkServlet` and get access to `CrnkBoot`. The code below shows a sample implementation:

[source]
.SampleCrnkServlet.java
----
include::../../../../crnk-setup/crnk-setup-servlet/src/test/java/io/crnk/servlet/SampleCrnkServlet.java[tags=docs]
----

The newly created servlet must be added to the ``web.xml`` file or to another deployment descriptor.
The code below shows a sample ``web.xml`` file with a properly defined and configured servlet:

[source]
----
  <web-app>
    <servlet>
      <servlet-name>SampleCrnkServlet</servlet-name>
      <servlet-class>io.crnk.servlet.SampleCrnkServlet</servlet-class>
      <init-param>
        <!-- can typically be ommitted and is auto-detected -->
        <param-name>crnk.config.core.resource.domain</param-name>
        <param-value>http://www.mydomain.com</param-value>
      </init-param>
    </servlet>
    <servlet-mapping>
      <servlet-name>SampleCrnkServlet</servlet-name>
      <url-pattern>/api/v1/ *</url-pattern>
    </servlet-mapping>
  </web-app>
----

`init-param` allow to pass configuration flags to Crnk. For a list of properties see <<properties,here>>.


### Integrating using a filter

Integrating Crnk as a Servlet filter works in a very similar fashion as for servlets:

[source]
.SampleCrnkFilter.java
----
include::../../../../crnk-setup/crnk-setup-servlet/src/test/java/io/crnk/servlet/SampleCrnkFilter.java[tags=docs]
----

The newly created filter must be added to ``web.xml`` file or other deployment descriptor.
A code below shows a sample ``web.xml`` file with properly defined and configured filter

[source]
----
  <web-app>
    <filter>
      <filter-name>SampleCrnkFilter</filter-name>
      <filter-class>io.crnk.servlet.SampleCrnkFilter</filter-class>
      <init-param>
        <!-- can typically be ommitted and is auto-detected -->
        <param-name>crnk.config.core.resource.domain</param-name>
        <param-value>http://www.mydomain.com</param-value>
      </init-param>
    </filter>
  </web-app>
----

`init-param` allow to pass configuration flags to Crnk. For a list of properties see <<properties,here>>.

## Integration with Spring and String Boot

Crnk provides with:

- `io-crnk:crnk-setup-spring` support for plain Spring 4 and 5.
- `io-crnk:crnk-setup-spring-boot1` support for Spring Boot 1.x. This module is considered being deprecated and will be removed in the future.
- `io-crnk:crnk-setup-spring-boot2` support for Spring Boot 2.x.



There is a `CrnkCoreAutoConfiguration` in  `crnk-setup-spring-boot2` that outlines
the basic setup that can easily be applied to a Spring-only setup without Spring Boot using `crnk-setup-spring`:

- It uses the `CrnkFilter` servlet filter to fetch the requests.
- Service discovery is performed with `SpringServiceDiscovery` using the Spring `ApplicationContext`.

There are further auto configurations that automatically setup various Crnk modules. And there are also further integrations into Spring (like for `RestTemplate`
and Spring Security). More information is available in <<spring_modules,Spring modules>>.

The web integration can be customized for Spring Boot setups with the subsequent properties:

[source]
.application.properties
----
crnk.enabled=true
crnk.domain-name=http://localhost:8080
crnk.path-prefix=/api
crnk.default-page-limit=20
crnk.max-page-limit=1000
crnk.allow-unknown-attributes=false
crnk.return404-on-null=true
----

See https://github.com/crnk-project/crnk-framework/blob/master/crnk-setup/crnk-setup-spring-boot2/src/main/java/io/crnk/setup/spring/boot/core/CrnkCoreProperties.java[CrnkCoreProperties] for more information.
The <<spring_modules,Spring modules>> and their auto configurations make further configuration properties available.




## Integration with Vert.x

CAUTION: Reactive programming support has been introduced in Crnk 2.6 and is still considered experimental
  with some limitations. Please also provide feedback about this Vert.x integration.

Crnk integrates with Vert.x RxJava 2 using `crnk-reactive` and `crnk-setup-vertx`. More information about
reactive programming is available <<reactive,here>>. To make use of Crnk with Vert.x, make sure you have
the following dependencies specified:

[source]
----
	compile 'io.crnk:crnk-setup-vertx'
	compile 'io.vertx:vertx-rx-java2'
----

An example Vert.x vehicle may then look like:

[source]
.CrnkVerticle.java
----
include::../../../../crnk-setup/crnk-setup-vertx/src/test/java/io/crnk/setup/vertx/CrnkVerticle.java[tags=docs]
----

`CrnkVertxHandler` holds the Crnk setup. Its constructor takes a `Consumer<CrnkBoot>` that allows the customization
of Crnk. The example makes use of it to register two modules. `CrnkVertxHandler.process` is the main method
that allows to process `HttpServerRequest` objects of Vert.x.


## Discovery with CDI

To enable CDI support, add ``io.crnk:crnk-cdi`` to your classpath. Crnk will then pickup the
``CdiServiceDiscovery`` implementation and use it to discover its modules and repositories. Modules, repositories,
etc. will then be picked up if they are registered as CDI beans.

By default `Cdi.current()` is used to obtain a `BeanManager`. The application may also make use of
`CdiServiceDiscovery.setBeanManager(...)` to set a custom one. The various integrations like `CrnkFeature` provide
a `setServiceDiscovery` method to set a customized instance.

WARNING: `Cdi.current()` has shown to be unreliable in some cases when doing EAR deployment. In such cases
it is highly recommended to set the `BeanManager manually`.

## Discovery with Guice

A `GuiceServiceDiscovery` implementation is provided. The various integrations like `CrnkFeature` provide
a `setServiceDiscovery` method to set the instance. For an example have a look at the dropwizard example
application (https://github.com/crnk-project/crnk-framework/tree/master/crnk-examples/dropwizard-simple-example).


## Discovery with Spring

The Spring integration comes with a ``SpringServiceDiscovery`` that makes use of the Spring `ApplicationContext`
to discover beans.


## Discovery without a dependency injection framework

WARNING: This mechanism is considered to be rather deprecated and a lightweight dependency injection framework like guice or
the setup of manual modules is recommended instead.

If no dependency injection framework is used, Crnk can also discover beans on its own. For this purpose,
the `org.reflections:reflections` library has to be added to the classpath and the
`CrnkProperties.RESOURCE_SEARCH_PACKAGE` be defined. In JAX-RS this may look like:

[source]
----
@ApplicationPath("/")
	public class MyApplication extends Application {

		@Override
        public Set<Object> getSingletons() {
            CrnkFeature crnkFeature = new CrnkFeature();
            crnkFeature.getBoot().setServiceLocator(...);
            return Collections.singleton((Object)crnkFeature);
        }

		@Override
        public Map<String, Object> getProperties() {
            Map<String, Object> map = new HashMap<>();
            map.put(CrnkProperties.RESOURCE_SEARCH_PACKAGE, "com.myapplication.model")
            return map;
        }
	}
----

A `JsonServiceLocator` service locator can be provided to control the instatiation of object. By default the default
constructor will be used. The `CrnkProperties.RESOURCE_SEARCH_PACKAGE` property is passed to define which package
should be searched for beans. Multiple packages can be passed by specifying a comma separated string
of packages i.e. com.company.service.dto,com.company.service.repository. It will pick up any public non-abstract
class that makes use of Crnk interfaces, like repositories, exception mappers and modules.

## No Discovery

It is also possible to make use of no discovery mechanism at all. In this case it is still possible to add repositories
and other features through modules. A simple example looks like:

[source]
.DropwizardService
----
include::../../../../crnk-examples/dropwizard-simple-example/src/main/java/io/crnk/example/dropwizard/simple/DropwizardService.java[tags=docs]
----

Have a look at the various <<modules>> chapters for more information.


## Implement a custom discovery mechanism

Application can bring along there own implementation of `ServiceDiscovery`. For more information
see <<customdiscovery,here>>.

anchor:CrnkBoot[]

## CrnkBoot

`CrnkBoot` is a class shared among all the different integrations that takes care of setting up and starting
Crnk. Every integration will provide access to it, which in turn allows for virtually any kind of customization.

Some possibilities:

- `getObjectMapper` allows access to the used Jackson instance.
- `addModule` allows to add a module.
- `setServiceDiscovery` sets a custom service discovery mechanism.
- `setPropertiesProvider` allows to set how properties are resolved.
- `getQuerySpecDeserializer` and `setQuerySpecDeserializer` allows to reconfigure how parameters are parsed.
   Note that in some areas JSON API only provides reocmmendations and Crnk follows those recommendations
   by default. So depending on your use cases, you may want to configure or implement some aspects differently.
- `setMaxPageLimit` allows to set the maximum number of allowed resources that can be fetched with a request
   by limiting pagination.
- `setDefaultPageLimit` allows to set a default page limit if none is specified by the request. *Highly
   recommended* to be used as people frequently browse repositories on there own with a web browser and
   fail to provide pagination. As a result, your entire database may get downloaded and may bring down
   your servers depending on the datasize.

IMPORTANT: Appropriate page limits are vital to protect against denial-of-service attacks when working
with large data sets! Such attacks may not be of malicious nature, but normal users using a browser
and just omitting to specify pagination parameters.

anchor:properties[]

## Properties

Any of the integrations allows API access to customize Crnk. There are also a number of configuration flags
provided by `CrnkProperties`:

* `crnk.config.core.resource.domain`
  Domain name as well as protocol and optionally port number used when building links objects in responses i.e. http://crnk.io.
  The value must not end with ``/``. If the property is omitted, then they are extracted from the incoming request, which should work
  well for most use cases.

* `crnk.config.web.path.prefix`
  Default prefix of a URL path used in two cases:
  ** When building ``links`` objects in responses
  ** When performing method matching
  An example of a prefix ``/api/v1``.

* `crnk.config.include.paging.packagingEnabled` enables pagination for inclusions. Disabled by default. Be aware this may
  inadvertently enable pagination for included resources when doing paging on root resources if data structures
  are cyclic. See `CrnkProperties.INCLUDE_PAGING_ENABLED` fore mor information.

* `crnk.config.include.behavior` with possible values `BY_TYPE` (default) and `BY_ROOT_PATH`.
   `BY_ROOT_PATH` specifies that an inclusion can only requested as path from the root
   resource such as `include[tasks]=project.schedule`. While `BY_TYPE` can further request
   inclusions by type directly such as `include[tasks]=project&include[projects]=schedule`.
   For simple object structures they are semantically the same, but they do differ
   for more complex ones, like when multiple attributes lead
   to the same type or for cycle structures. In the later case BY_TYPE inclusions
   become recursive, while BY_ROOT_PATH do not. Note that the use of BY_TYPE
   outmatches BY_ROOT_PATH, so BY_TYPE includes everything BY_ROOT_PATH does
   and potentially more. For more information see `CrnkProperties.INCLUDE_BEHAVIOR`.

* `crnk.config.resource.immutableWrite` with values IGNORE (default) or FAIL.
  Determines how to deal with field that cannot be changed upon a PATCH or POST
  request. For more information see `CrnkProperties.RESOURCE_FIELD_IMMUTABLE_WRITE_BEHAVIOR`.

* `crnk.config.resource.response.return_404` with values true and false (default).
  Enforces a 404 response should a repository return a null value. This is common practice, but
  not strictly mandated by the JSON API specification. In general it is recommended for
  repository to throw `ResourceNotFoundException`.

* `crnk.config.serialize.object.links` to serialize links as objects. See
  http://jsonapi.org/format/#document-links. Disabled by default.

* `crnk.config.resource.request.rejectPlainJson` whether to reject GET requests with
  `application/json` accept headers and enforce `application/vnd.api+json`. Disabled by default.

* `crnk.config.resource.request.allowUnknownAttributes` lets Crnk ignore unknown filter and sort parameters. Disabled by default.

* `crnk.config.serialize.object.links` determines whether links should be serialized as simple string (default) or as
  objects (with a `self` attribute holding the url).

* `crnk.config.resource.request.rejectPlainJson` determines whether Crnk should reject `application/json` requests to  JSON-API
   endpoints. Disabled by default. The JSON-API specification mandates the use of the `application/vnd.api+json`
   MIME-Type. In cases where frontends or intermediate proxies prefer the `application/json` MIME-Type, that type can be sent in
   the `Accept` header instead.
   If an application wants to serve a different response depending on whether the client's `Accept` header
   contains `application/vnd.api+json` or `application/json`, this option can be enabled.
   This *does not affect the payload `Content-Type`. `POST` and `PATCH` requests must still use
  `Content-Type: application/vnd.api+json` to describe their request body
