With this release the first version of Crnk 3.x is released. There
have been many incremental improvements
to the code base over the past year. In particular the relationship handling has been automated
in a number of ways. 3.0 has taken the features and learnings from this time and improves upon some of the
configuration defaults. This in turn allows to setup resources and relationships
more simply, more quickly and  with fewer lines of code. A variety of new features complement the release,
most notably the generation of Asciidoc documentation and a type-safe query API.
While being a major release, changes required should be minimal (see below).
<p>
    A first BETA is available. Further BETA releases are going to finalize the new features
    and providing more documentation and examples.
</p>


<h4>Cleanup &amp; Migration</h4>

<ul>
    <li>
        The V2 suffixes have been removed from the repository interfaces. They have been in place for historic reasons
        to replace QueryParams-based repositories. QueryParams carry new &quot;Legacy&quot; prefix.
    </li>
    <li>
        Repository interface make us of the Collection type rather than Iterable. The later can be quite cumbersome to
        use
        and not necessary for this particular use cases.
    </li>
    <li>
        Resource identifier no longer must extend Serializable. There has been no requirements and complicated
        their usage.
    </li>
    <li>
        RelationshipRepositoryV2 and BulkRelationshipRepositoryV2 have been deprecated in favor
        of OneRelationshipRepository and ManyRelationshipRepository. The new repositories
        have a number of advantages. Finders of the new repositories follow
        the concepts of BulkRelationshipRepositoryV2 to have efficiency by default. RelationshipMatch
        is used by default to bind the repository to resources.
        Repositories may still implement
        both interfaces to gain the original RelationshipRepositoryV2 functionality.
    </li>
    <li>
        JPA repositories with DTO mapping now behave exactly like regular resources. Make sure that
        the DTOs are properly annotation with @JsonApiRelation and @JsonApiRelationId. No information is
        inferred from the underlying entities.
    </li>
    <li>
        RepositoryDecoratorFactory has been simplified to a single decorateRepository method and
        WrappedResourceRepository, WrappedOneRelationshipRepository and WrappedManyRelationshipRepository.
        There are no dedicated decoration repository interfaces anymore, just the regular interfaces.
    </li>
    <li>
        Decorators have been removed form the JpaRepositoryConfig. The regular RepositoryDecoratorFactory can be
        used instead.
    </li>
    <li>
        @JsonApiRelation.oppositeName has been deprecated in favor of @JsonApiRelation.mappedBy.
        See below for more information. Be aware of the changed semantics. The property must only be
        set on one side.
    </li>
    <li>New defaults for @JsonApiRelation.lookup and @JsonApiRelation.repositoryBehavior should
        allow to eliminate a large part of the custom configuration. For more information see below.
    </li>
    <li>
        crnk-jpa has been renamed to crnk-data-jpa and the Java package updated accordingly.
    </li>
    <li>
        crnk-activiti has been renamed to crnk-data-activiti and the Java package updated accordingly.
    </li>
    <li>
        Let us know if you still continue to make use of QueryParams. Otherwise it is going to get dropped
        in a subsequent Beta release.
    </li>
</ul>

<h4>Update Examples application</h4>

Still work in progress, but <a href="https://github.com/crnk-project/crnk-example">crnk-example</a> has been
updated to use the various 3.0 features.


<h4>Simplified Relationship Setup with @JsonApiRelation.mappedBy</h4>

@JsonApiRelation.oppositeName has been deprecated in favor of @JsonApiRelation.mappedBy. It must be set
for bi-directional relationships to point from the non-owning to the owning side:

<pre class="prettyprint">
@JsonApiResource(type = "tasks")
public class Task {

    @JsonApiRelation
    private Project project;

    ...
}

@JsonApiResource(type = "tasks")
public class Task {

    @JsonApiRelation(mappedBy="project")
    private Set&lt;Task&gt; tasks;

    ...
}
</pre>

<p>
    The owning side is typically the single-valued field. This is because the single-valued field
    is something like a column in a database table that can be accessed and updated. In contrast,
    the multi-valued field can only be obtained by specifying issuing a query against the single-valued field
    and as such not suitable to be the owner. The behavior matches with similar JPA-related annotations.
</p>
<p>
    Under the hood the mappedBy property will trigger a suitable default for @JsonApiRelation.repositoryBehavior
    and @JsonApiRelation.lookup on both sides, simplifying the relationship setup for most use cases.
    If no relationship repository can be setup, Crnk will no fail directly upon startup.
</p>

<h4>Improved default values for @JsonApiRelation</h4>

Relationship implementation can greatly vary. For this reason the various attributes of @JsonApiRelation historically
had most features disabled by default (forwarding, serialization, etc.) to let developers configure what is needed.
Over the past year a variety of tooling has been added to simplify the relationship setup, which in turn
made the conservative defaults less suited than in the past. With this release new defaults have been introduced
that inspect the resources and repositories more closely to decide for a particular default value for
@JsonApiRelation.lookUp and @JsonApiRelation.repositoryBehavior.
<p>
    In many cases it should no longer be necessary to specify those properties, for example:

<pre class="prettyprint">
@JsonApiResource(type = "task")
public class Task {
    @JsonApiId
    public String id;

    @JsonApiRelation // not backed by repository
    public Project project;

    @JsonApiRelation // backed by repository
    public List<Task> subTasks;
}

@JsonApiResource(type = "project")
public class Project {
    @JsonApiId
    public String id;

    @JsonApiRelation(mappedBy = "project")
    public Set<Task> tasks;

    @JsonApiRelationId
    public Project parentId;

    @JsonApiRelation
    public Project parent;
}

class SubTaskRepository extends OneRelationshipRepositoryBase {
    @Override
    public RelationshipMatcher getMatcher() {
        RelationshipMatcher matcher = new RelationshipMatcher();
        matcher.rule().field("subTasks").add();
        return matcher;
    }
    ...
}
</pre>

the updated documentation and the new example in the
<a href="documentation/#_jsonapirelation">documentation</a>.

More information is available in the documentation. Please provide feedback in this area!


<h4>Go Faster with Graal Native</h4>

<p>
    <i>This feature will be available in a subsequent BETA release</i>
</p>

Sub-100ms startup times and reduced memory requirements to reduce cost and open up new application fields
like serverless computing.


<h4>Type-safe QuerySpec construction with a Crnk Annotation Processor</h4>

<p>
    <i>Available as a preview in the first BETA</i>
</p>

An annotation processor is introduced that allows the type-safe construction of QuerySpec and PathSpec.


<pre class="prettyprint">
UserQuerySpec querySpec = new UserQuerySpec();
        querySpec.sort().loginId().desc();
        querySpec.filter().projects().id().filter(FilterOperator.EQ, 12);
        querySpec.field().loginId();
        querySpec.include().projects();
</pre>

More information can be found <a href="documentation/#_java_annotation_processor">here</a>.


<h4>More flexible Gradle generator plugin</h4>

The Gradle Typescript generator adds support for the generation of artifacts other than Typescript.

<pre class="prettyprint">
buildscript {
	dependencies {
		classpath "io.crnk:crnk-gen-gradle:${version}"
	}
}

apply plugin: 'crnk-gen'
crnkGen {
    runtime {
        configuration = 'typescriptGenRuntime'
    }

    forked = true
    resourcePackages = ['io.crnk.example.api']

    typescript {
        enabled = true
        format = 'PLAINJSON'
        genDir = file('src/resources')
    }
}
</pre>

For this purpose the project has been split into `crnk-gen-gradle`, `crnk-gen-typescript` and a number of
helper projects.  More information about Typescript generation is available
<a href="documentation/#_typescript">here</a>.


<h4>Documentation generation with AsciiDoc</h4>

The new <i>crnk-gen-asciidoc</i> project helps automating REST documentation. It makes use of two kinds of sources:
resource classes and test cases. The resource classes give an overview of a REST endpoint with a list of available
resources, attributes and relationships. Whereas test cases can serve as examples for developers. This mix
of model-driven and test-driven documentation together with the standardization provided by JSON:API
can greatly help in writing consistent, documented REST endpoints.

<p>
<table>
    <tr>
        <td>
            <img src="asciidoc_example.png" width="70%">
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>
</p>

<a href="https://github.com/crnk-project/crnk-example">crnk-example</a>.


<h4>Allow QuerySpec conversion to Criteria query</h4>

The following code snipped shows how to convert a QuerySpec to Criteria query without involving repositories:

<pre class="prettyprint">
JpaCriteriaQueryFactory queryFactory = JpaCriteriaQueryFactory.newInstance(em);

PathSpec idAttr = PathSpec.of(TestEntity.ATTR_id);
QuerySpec querySpec = new QuerySpec(TestEntity.class);
querySpec.addFilter(idAttr.filter(FilterOperator.GT, 0L));
querySpec.addSort(idAttr.sort(Direction.DESC));
querySpec.includeField(PathSpec.of("oneRelatedValue"));

JpaCriteriaQuery&lt;TestEntity&gt; query = queryFactory.query(TestEntity.class);
JpaQueryExecutor&lt;TestEntity&gt; executor = query.buildExecutor(querySpec);
List&lt;TestEntity&gt; resultList = executor.getResultList();
</pre>


<h4>InMemoryHttpAdapter to connect CrnkClient with a server</h4>

There is a new InMemoryHttpAdapter implementation completing OkHttp, Apache HTTP client and RestTemplate.
InMemoryHttpAdapter takes a CrnkBoot instance as parameter to directly connecting to a server without
having to go through any TCP/HTTP transport layer. Requests are still serialized and deserialized, but
no running HTTP server is necessary. Unit testing can greatly benefit from such a more simpler
and faster setup:

<pre class="prettyprint">
    String url = ...
    CrnkClient client = new CnrkClient(url).
    client.setHttpAdapter(new InMemoryHttpAdapter(crnkBoot, url));
</pre>


<h4>HttpAdapterListener for a vendor-neutral HTTP request/response interception</h4>

A new HttpAdapterListener can be added with addListener to HttpAdapter. It allows to cover many of the typical
use cases like adding security headers without having to get and customize the underlying HTTP implementation.


<h4>crnk-format-plain-json in CrnkClient</h4>

The PlainJsonFormatModule can now be added to CrnkClient. This is in particular useful together with
the Asciidoc generator to create documentation in the plain json format for consumer making use of it.


<h4>Prettier URLs computation</h4>

Computed links (CrnkClient, pagination, etc.) by default omit the `EQ` operator and type information where
not necessary. This leads to more readable URLs like:

<pre class="prettyprint">
    http://127.0.0.1/api/tasks?filter[name]=Doe
</pre>

rather than

<pre class="prettyprint">
    http://127.0.0.1/api/tasks?filter[tasks][name][EQ]=Doe
</pre>


<h4>OpenTracing Support</h4>

OpenTracing is a vendor-neutral API to write trace information. crnk-monitor-opentracing introduces a new module OpenTracingServerModule
that brings support for OpenTracing to Crnk. It can be used properly set the names of spans. More information is available
in the documentation.

<p>
    <img src="tracing.png" width="70%">
</p>


<h4>Singular Nested Resources</h4>

Support for nested resources has been improved by introducing support singular nested resources. Thereby a parent can hold a single nested resource as
single-valued relationships. Urls then look like:

<p>
    http://example.com/posts/1/header
</p>


<p>An example looks like:

<pre class="prettyprint">
@JsonApiResource(type = "header", nested = true)
public class PostHeader {

	@JsonApiId
	@JsonApiRelationId
	private String postId;

	private String value;

	@JsonApiRelation(opposite = "header", lookUp = LookupIncludeBehavior.AUTOMATICALLY_WHEN_NULL,
			repositoryBehavior = RelationshipRepositoryBehavior.FORWARD_OWNER)
	private Post post;

	...
}
</pre>

More information can be found <a href="documentation/#_nested_resources">here</a>.


<h4>Enum support for Activiti</h4>

crnk-data-jpa maps Enum types to Strings for Activiti. This to by-pass the regular Activiti serialization mechanism that
treats the enum like a java.lang.Object by storing it is as serialized blob and not supporting filtering.


<h4>More flexible EntityManager setup with JPA module</h4>

JpaModule.createServerModule(...) comes with a new flavor that allows to pass the EntityManager
as java.util.Supplier. Every time a repository makes use of the EntityManager, the supplier is called and must
return an instance. The supplier together with the existing TransactionRunner
allows for custom JPA setups and transaction handling.
