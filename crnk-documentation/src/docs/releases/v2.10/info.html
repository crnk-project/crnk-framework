<h4>More flexible document formats</h4>

So far Crnk followed the JSON API specification to the letter to establish a REST endpoint. The motivation of this was
to have a clearly defined standard. In particular the relationship handling and inclusions allow to built powerful applications
(such as when working with the redux pattern on the client side).
However, at the same time this feature can make more simpler applications harder to write since
they are forced to resolve those relationships. With <b>crnk-format-plain-json</b> a new module <b>PlainJsonFormatModule</b>
is introduced that allows to setup alternative, custom document format next to JSON API. The ACCEPT and CONTENT-TYPE header will determine
whether the JSON API or that custom format is used. An example can look like:

<pre class="prettyprint">
{
  "data" : {
    "id" : "12",
    "type" : "tasks",
    "name" : "someTask",
    "schedule" : {
      "data" : null,
      "links" : {
        "self" : "http://localhost:8080/tasks/12/relationships/schedule",
        "related" : "http://localhost:8080/tasks/12/schedule"
      }
    },
    "project" : {
      "data" : {
        "id" : "1",
        "type" : "projects",
        "name" : "someProject"
      },
      "links" : {
        "self" : "http://localhost:8080/tasks/12/relationships/project",
        "related" : "http://localhost:8080/tasks/12/project"
      }
    }
  }
}
</pre>

Most notably the project relationship is directly inlined with the task. And a resource is written in a more flat manner without the
<i>attributes</i> and
<i>relationships</i> containers. Contributions to add more flexibility to the module are always welcome.


<h4>Improved default settings</h4>

To simplify development, two further flags have been enabled by default to simplify development. The flags have been disabled for historic
reasons to maintain backward compatibility, but the longer the more they rather cause issues rather than help with compatibility. Both
flags can be turned-off again if desired, but in general not recommended.
<p>
The first concerns `TypeParser.setEnforceJackson` that is enabled by default. It affects how filter parameters are serialized and deserialized
to urls. Among others, it was by default searching for `parse` methods and constructors with a single String parameter. This behavior
is no longer active. Instead always Jackson and its ObjectMapper is used for the mapping (as long as no custom StringMapper is installed with
TypeParser). You may want to make use the following annotation to make custom value classes String-serializable:

<pre class="prettyprint">
<![CDATA[
	@JsonSerialize(using = ToStringSerializer.class)
]]>
</pre>

In this case the toString method and String constructor is used by Jackson as well.
<p>
The second property concerns crnk.enforceIdName that is now enabled by default. This will result that all @JsonApiId-annotated fields are
named &quot;id&quot; on the REST layer regardless of the name in Java. This matches the JSON API specification. It mainly affects
the naming in sort and filter parameters.
