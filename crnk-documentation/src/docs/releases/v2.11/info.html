<h4>Nested Filters</h4>

Typical filter patterns like <a href="/tasks?filter[name][EQ]=Super task`">/tasks?filter[name][EQ]=Super task` </a>
work well for most use cases. This release brings further support for complex, nested filters through
JSON. It allows arbitrary nesting of AND, OR and NOT expressions. For example:

<pre class="prettyprint">
http://127.0.0.1:8080/projects?filter={"OR": {"name": "Great Project", "LE": {"id": 122}}}
</pre>

More information is available in the <a href="documentation/#_nested_filtering">documentation</a>.

<h4>Revised JPA Setup</h4>

The JPA module has a long history with being the first module of Crnk. For this
reason it has shown a bit its age and other places evolved quite a bit in the meantime.
This release comes with a simplified, improved setup. Instead of configuring the JpaModule itself,
the application can specify repositories extending from JpaEntityRepositoryBase:

<pre class="prettyprint">
@Component
public class ScheduleRepositoryImpl extends JpaEntityRepositoryBase<ScheduleEntity, Long> {

    public ScheduleRepositoryImpl() {
        super(ScheduleEntity.class);
    }
}
</pre>

The JPA module will detect those repositories and make them work like in the past with more explicit
configuration. The new setup has a number of advantages:

<ul>
    <li>
        It is a regular repository like any other. In case of Spring Boot you can, for example,
        inject it anywhere you like as it is a managed bean.
    </li>
    <li>
        It makes use of the forwarding repository behaviors (see @JsonApiRelation) to
        forward relationship calls to either side. So in case of customizations, only the
        resource repositories have to be customized, the relationships will follow automatically.
    </li>
    <li>
        Having a repository at hand allows to do any kind of customizations without having
        to rely on decorators.
    </li>
</ul>

The old configuration mechanism is still in place and can continued to be used.


<h4>@JsonApiField support for relationships</h4>

Support for the readable, patchable, postable, deletable properties of @JsonApiField have been
added to relationships to complement the current support of basic attributes.


<h4>Support for parameterized super types</h4>

Fields in super type can now be parameterized through generics. Crnk will properly resolve those types
in subtypes.

<h4>Fix for relationship link handling</h4>

Self and related relationship links now make proper use of linking, such as paging.

<h4>A custom Spring Boot tag provider</h4>

Used to properly resolve URIs within the Spring MVC metrics mechanisms.
