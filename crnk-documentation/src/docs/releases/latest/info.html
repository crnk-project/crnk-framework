<h4>Nested Filters</h4>

Typical filter patterns like <a href="/tasks?filter[name][EQ]=Super task`">/tasks?filter[name][EQ]=Super task` </a>
work well for most use cases. This release brings further support for complex, nested filters through
JSON. It allows arbitrary nesting of AND, OR and NOT expressions. For example:

<pre class="prettyprint">
http://127.0.0.1:8080/projects?filter={"OR": {"name": "Great Project", "LE": {"id": 122}}}
</pre>

More information is available in the <a href="stable/documentation/#_nested_filtering">documentation</a>.
