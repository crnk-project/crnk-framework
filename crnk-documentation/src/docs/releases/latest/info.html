<h4>More flexible document formats</h4>

So far Crnk followed the JSON API specification to the letter to establish a REST endpoint. The motivation of this was
to have a clearly defined standard. In particular the relationship handling and inclusions allow to built powerful applications
(such as when working with the redux pattern on the client side).
However, at the same time this feature can make more simpler applications harder to write since
they are forced to resolve those relationships. With <b>crnk-format-plain-json</b> a new module <b>PlainJsonFormatModule</b>
is introduced that allows to setup alternative, custom document format next to JSON API. The ACCEPT and CONTENT-TYPE header will determine
whether the JSON API or that custom format is used. An example can look like:

<pre class="prettyprint">
{
  "data" : {
    "id" : "12",
    "type" : "tasks",
    "name" : "someTask",
    "schedule" : {
      "data" : null,
      "links" : {
        "self" : "http://localhost:8080/tasks/12/relationships/schedule",
        "related" : "http://localhost:8080/tasks/12/schedule"
      }
    },
    "project" : {
      "data" : {
        "id" : "1",
        "type" : "projects",
        "name" : "someProject"
      },
      "links" : {
        "self" : "http://localhost:8080/tasks/12/relationships/project",
        "related" : "http://localhost:8080/tasks/12/project"
      }
    }
  }
}
</pre>

Most notably the project relationship is directly inlined with the task. And a resource is written in a more flat manner without the
<i>attributes</i> and
<i>relationships</i> containers. Contributions to add more flexibility to the module are always welcome.
