<h4>Removal of deprecated Repository annotations</h4>

The annotation-based repositories have been deprecated since Crnk 0.x and have now been removed. A switch to the Interface-based repositories like
ResourceRepositoryV2 is quickly implemented if somewhere still necessary.

<h4>Downsizing of QueryParams code base</h4>

QueryParams has been deprecated since Crnk 0.x. So far both QuerySpec and QueryParams have been first-class citizens within Crnk. With this release, support
for QueryParams has been downsized. This means that any parsing and processing of QueryParams has been removed, but the conversion of QuerySpec
to QueryParams is still in place. The use of this conversion has been recommended for a long time to facilitate moving to QuerySpec, which also means nothing
should change or project just have to catch up with this conversion setup. With this setup, QueryParams continues to be supported in the near future,
but with a much lighter code base.	It is desired to remove QueryParams entirely from crnk-core in subsequent releases. Either by setting up a new
crnk-core-queryparams or dropping support for it entirely. Contributions in this area are welcomed if it desired to keep support alive.
Otherwise it will be dropped in early 2019.


<h4>Simplified QuerySpec with new PathSpec</h4>

All the QuerySpec-related objects like FilterSpec and SortSpec now hold the attribute path
as PathSpec. PathSpec facilitate working with paths compared to the previous List&lt;String&gt; solution.
All the previous API remains unchanged and supported (no deprecations).

<p>PathSpec offers various of(...) methods to quickly create an instance. It further offers
	filter(...) and sort(...) methods to construct FilterSpec and SortSpecs out of the current path.



<h4>QuerySpecVisitor</h4>

The new QuerySpecVisitor and QuerySpecVisitorBase classes allow to visit
a QuerySpec by calling QuerySpec.accept(QuerySpecVisitor). Visitors can be used, for example,
to easily modify attribute paths within a QuerySpc.


<h4>Classpath scanning for Typescript generator</h4>

The Typescript generator used to need a running application to extract information about the set
of resources and repositories. This remains the best and only way to reliably extract all informations
out of a Crnk-based application. However, due to this architecture, generation is also prone to fail
due to misconfiguration of the application. For this reason, this release introduces an new, alternative
mechanism where
the classpath can be scanned for @JsonApiResource-annotated classes and repository interface
definitions extending ResourceRepositoryV2. The benefit is a simpler setup at the cost of potentially
missing out on non-standard repositories that are not backed by a @JsonApiResource annotation.
In Gradle this then looks like:

<pre class="prettyprint">
typescriptGen{
  resourcePackages = ['Ã®o.crnk.example']
  ...
}
</pre>



<h4>@JpaResource annotation deprecated</h4>

@JpaResource rather than @JsonApiResource has historically been necessary to modify the naming
of Entity-based resources. This is no longer necessary and @JsonApiResource can be used together
with classes annotated with @Entity.


<h4>Historic Activiti repositories</h4>

There is initial experimental support for historic resource repositories of Activiti tasks and processes.

<pre class="prettyprint">
ActivitiModuleConfig config = new ActivitiModuleConfig();
ProcessInstanceConfig processConfig = config.addProcessInstance(ScheduleApprovalProcessInstance.class);
processConfig.historic(HistoricScheduleApprovalProcessInstance.class);

TaskRepositoryConfig taskConfig = config.addTask(ApproveTask.class);
taskConfig.historic(HistoricApproveTask.class);
taskConfig.filterBy("description", ENFORCED_DESCRIPTION);
return ActivitiModule.create(processEngine, config);
</pre>


<h4>Simplified customizations of Criteria-based crnk-jpa repositories</h4>

There is a new interface JpaCriteriaRepositoryFilter and base class JpaCriteriaRepositoryFilterBase that allow
easy customization of CriteriaQuery objects. The interfaces are a specialization of JpaRepositoryFilter
and can be used in the same manner by registering it to the JpaModuleConfig.


<h4>InMemoryEvaluator</h4>

InMemoryEvaluator gained a new constructor that takes a ResourceRegistry. This allows the use of resource information
when accessing resources. This allows its use with more customized resources and relationships, like the use of
@JsonApiRelationId and custom ResourceFieldAccessors instead of just basic plain Java beans. Note that QuerySpec.apply(...)
does not have access to a ResourceRegistry and, consequently, continues to use the traditional behavior.

<h4>Logging in crnk-meta</h4>

Various logging statements have been reduced to level TRACE to make the general DEBUG log level of io.crnk a bit less noisy.

<h4>@JsonApiRelationId supported by crnk-validation</h4>

Validation errors on relationship identifiers annotated with @JsonApiRelationId now correctly carry the relationship name (without the
typical "id" suffix) in the JSON API error.


<h4>Simplified BulkRelationshipRepositoryV2</h4>

The BulkRelationshipRepositoryV2 interface implements two default methods that allow the implementation of a single findTargets method.
A future V3 version of the interface will likely move this into crnk-core to keep the interface this simple without having to rely
on default methods.

<h4>simplified crnk-jpa setup in Spring Boot</h4>

The exposeAll behavior automatically backs-off if a repository is registered manually. Setting the properly to false is no longer necessary.
