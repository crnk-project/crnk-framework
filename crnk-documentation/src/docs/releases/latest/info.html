<h4>Support for inheritance with a single repository per type hierarchy</h4>

A new attribute <i>subTypes</i> was introduced to @JsonApiResource to specify an inheritance relationship. For example:

<pre class="prettyprint">
  @JsonApiResource(type = "task", subTypes = SpecialTask.class)
  public class Task {
    // fields, getters and setters
  }

  @JsonApiResource(type = "specialTask", resourcePath = "task")
  public class SpecialTask extends Task{
    // fields, getters and setters
  }
</pre>

SpecialTask extends Task but is configured to use the same resourcePath, meaning SpecialTask does not have to bring
along its own repository implementation, but is served by the task repository.
For more information have a look at the documentation.


<h4>Microservice example</h4>

There is a new spring-boot-microservice-example application. It showcases how to establish relationships between resources of two separate microservices.
The relationship supports the full JSON API feature, most notable the use of inclusions. Behind the scenes crnk-client is used to let one Crnk instance
access another Crnk instance.


<h4>@JsonApiExpose annotation</h4>

@JsonApiExpose can be used to hide a resource repository from the JSON API endpoint. It is used by the preceding microservice example to hide the
remote repositories on the local endpoint while making them available internally to perform relationship inclusions.

<h4>InMemoryResourceRepository default implementation</h4>

There is a default implementation for a in-memory resource repository that is backed by a ConcurrentHashMap. It can be useful to get started quickly,
use for mocking and work with small data sets.
