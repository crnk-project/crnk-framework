## What is Crnk?

Crnk is an implementation of the [JSON API](https://http://jsonapi.org/) specification and recommendations in Java to 
facilitate building RESTful applications. It provides many conventions and building blocks that application can benefit from. 
This includes features such as  sorting, filtering, pagination, requesting complex object graphs, sparse 
field sets, attaching links to data or atomically execute multiple operations. Further integration 
with frameworks and libraries such as Spring, CDI, JPA, Bean Validation, Dropwizard, Servlet API, Zipkin and
and more ensure that JSON API plays well together with the Java ecosystem. Have a look at 
[www.crnk.io](http://www.crnk.io) and the [documentation](http://www.crnk.io/documentation/) for more detailed 
information.
